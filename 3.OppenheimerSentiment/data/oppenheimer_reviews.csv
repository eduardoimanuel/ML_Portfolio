"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves."
"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!"
"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil."
"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8."
"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles."
"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade."
"Although the time passed quickly, ultimately, Oppenheimer has left me disappointed. The problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. Both of those stories are depicted well, Nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. However, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. The film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white IMAX film stock."
"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue."
This movie pretends to be clever and artistic but in reality it's just a meandering bloated effort. The cast is wonderful and their performances do have merit there's no question about that. The fault is the story itself. You get the feeling that Christopher Nolan is such a big time director that no one around him has the guts to tell him no. When you surround even the most talented people with Yes Men the result is often inferior. Such is the case with this movie. The story is told through semi flashbacks and a jumping time narrative. What results is unsatisfying and what is seen has very little depth. They try to paint two historical figures back and forth as flawed protagonist yet fail in the delivery.
"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity."
"Nolan's best film will be in the biographical style. I hope he can do something like Nolan's Inception that will be remembered decades from now, because he himself said that great physicists were used for this film to work with precision and seriousness.Particle for direct object
CGI special effects are not used in this movie. It can be said that this excites people. Anyway, this year's movie is going to be better, no doubt about it and I'm really looking forward to it.It would be great if it became the best film of this year and the best director nominee.Nolan's amazing love You so much ."
"Waited three hours for an explosion and it was probably the most disappointing part of the film.Otherwise, a great movie with a great cast that will be talked about for decades.So glad that I am alive to watch Christopher Nolan in his prime still and glad that I am living in the return of cinema.Easily up there with the best film of the year, will definitely be winning an Oscar.(This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters)"
"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad."
"The captivating drama was carried away by supremely talented actors, with Cilian Murphy skillfully portraying the complex character of J. Robert Oppenheimer. After a long hiatus, RDJ (Acting POV) finally gets the recognition he deserves. The background music (BGM) is extraordinary, and the cinematography is exhilarating. Although I haven't read Kai Bird's ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" yet, I have watched NBC's latest documentary titled ""To End All War: Oppenheimer & The Atomic Bomb,"" which is more convenient to grasp as a whole. However, Nolan's portrayal of Oppenheimer was superior from an subjective point of view."
"This movie is an experience. The direction, cinematography and music will take you away. The performances from all the main actors are Oscar worthy. This movie will defy your expectations. Cillian Murphy is definitely Oscar's number 1 contender.Now I understand that this may not be every person's cup of tea. Some people are seriously going to this movie expecting to have a "" fun"" time. Tho movie speaks about ""probably"" the world's biggest catastrophe EVER. Some conversations are very heavy to bear but this is the world we live in and the choices humans and governments make every day.Can't wait to see Barbie next."
"I want to thanks to Chritoper Nolan that make this film be perfect. I have just knew that Robert Oppenheim is a man which make the atom bomb. This story in this film also make me speechless because I was influenced not to leave a single sentence on the screen. The bomb explosion is also very realistic, maybe that's what differentiates Nolan compared to other directors who prefer to use CGI. This film also tells about complex matters regarding life decisions taken by Oppenheimer, I like Oppenheimer's life principles without mentioning other stories. Thanks to C. Nolan for this very beautiful film."
"It is fitting that a film about a person as consequential as Oppenheimer ended up being crafted by one of the most visionary directors of our time. Oppenheimer is a victory for filmmaking, a tour de force of incredible visuals, breathtaking cinematography and a sweeping scope that makes this narrative so illuminating. Every single aspect of this film blends into a seamless, awe inspiring experience where despite its gargantuan runtime, we are transfixed to a portrait of a man who's legend will forever be written in history. Brought alive by a phenomenon Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer is the single greatest argument that movies and the theatrical experience still can mean something. If you watch this, definitely watch in 70mm IMAX - it's so worth it.Nolan has done what Hollywood desperately needed - make a coherent argument that filmmaking deserves a place in the pantheon of twenty first century art."
"A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me."
"An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher."
"Christopher Nolan is a savant of filmmaking. Cillian Murphy SHINES in this movie. They are one absolutely amazing duo. Not to mention a strong supporting cast around them and.""Oppenheimer"" is jam packed with information and begging to be watched 2, 3, 4 times. I walked out of the theater ready to watch it again already. It is fascinating and engages you the entire time you're watching.All of the performances by everyone involved bring the story to life to its fullest potential. They showed up and absolutely showed out on screen for this historical retelling: honestly a masterpiece. 1000% worth watching in theaters if you can."
"Nolan strangely moves from petentious films, bad ones right away after you take the glitter away, to straight ahead masterworks of movie making. He seams to go 1 good 1 bad each time. Now it was time for a good one after the pretentious, sloppy Tenet. And boy did he deliver. This is a wonderful, challenging, unapologetic, very brave in some political way piece of movie making. Well acted all along, well written, large in scope but fully accomplishing. But it's what lies underneath what I love the most. I'm totally in love with the political subplots: younger generations need to be reminded not only about the dangers of the bomb, but for the equally killing Macarthysms. Call it how you want it, the blind, stupid far righters are a danger to the world."
"What an amazing movie, the visuals, sound, music, acting, directing, everything was 10/10, dont watch the film without knowing some history, its very philosophical type of movie, it makes you question about your actions, reflect on life, consequences, every minute of 3hr was amazing there was no boring scene, very good pacing, I understand its not meant for all audiences, yeah some scenes maybe could have been avoided but regardless the purpose of the movie was executed, definitely the type of movie that will be remembered for a long time. We can already expect it to leas best picture, actor, supporting actor, actress, sound, score, director, adapted screenplay and many more,"
"Even with 3 hours sleep and a stomach ache for most of the day I didn't yawn once I was absolutely captivated/enthralled more than I thought I would be. This better be up for at least 10 nominations! It's very impressive how Christopher Nolan wrote and directed such an in depth crafty art political brilliance filled ironic to my sleep amount of this long winded extravaganza that is well acted throughout. I have autism I crave quantum mechanics, I even understood the numerous studies science related. One of the best Christoper Nolan films of his career, my last name is Nolan too I wish I was related to him! The sound design throughout is exceptional I'm sure that'll even win an award. I'm glad despite feeling rough today I got to see Oppenheimer with my mom and sister Emily."
"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype."
"Nolan yet again proved that why he's one of the finest directors till date with 0 disappointing movies.. Oppenheimer is exceptional..! Brilliant at performance level..terrifying and horrifying tense music..highly convincing screenplay..terrific and beautiful visuals..dark and complex nature (not comparable toll to other Nolan classics)...
Literally Nolan itself - school of masterpiece arts ..
Oppenheimer is very great epic and non linear..It will sure shot very horrific movie not for every audience! If you are dying to watch pure drama portion oriented cinema, If you want to see some terrifying psychological brilliance and If you're fan of anyone who are involved in this film - Go For It!! Oppenheimer should remain forever until the drama school and making exist."
"I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again."
"Disgrace. I feel sorry for the paper that carried these pointless rows of dialogue and the hard drives packed with nonsensical scenes.Did Scorsese get drunk at a party and claimed you're no good director if you make a movie less than 3hours long and now everybody is trying to live up to it?This could've been a short film packed with ambivalence, tention and regret - but it's just a diluted piece of propaganda meandering the dark hallways of Hollywood. Cilian did a decent job, but the rest of the leading cast is just cringeworthy.Can't even grade it, it was unwatchable til the end, left the movies and stared at the ceiling, it was more fun."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a smarter, more skilled and more serious film than any previous film by the talented Nolan could have led us to expect. It is at once an almost unrivaled biopic, a revealing historical document and a wake up call of gravest importance. As biopic it evokes the vividness of scene and ambiguity of protagonist portrait of the ultimately fictional ""Citizen Kane,"" and even some of that film's wit. As historical document it has the factual specificity of ""All the President's Men."" As historical document it packs the essay-like messaging and dramatic tension of ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" with comparable virtuosity and stronger final emotional and intellectual impacts."
"In a world that's problematic you're perplexing, spending your time with particles, that are complexing, pushing boundaries to their limits, the fission/fusion of new physics, with the clashes, conflicts, contests you elicit. As a consequence you setup two big bangs, when you execute through governmental plans, although this story does not dwell, on the hell that you propel, to the people who are wiped out in Japan. In the end we're left to ponder motivations, of those who seek to play, with torments and damnations, of those who hide inside the shadows, pulling strings in Emperor's clothes, as they plot to raze the cornerstone foundations."
"I went into the movie with high expectations and overall it did deliver well.Pros: special effects, story, acting, casting, cinematography, soundtrack/music, ending was well doneCons: the beginning was a little messy for me, the audio for the dialogue could've been clearer - it was hard to heard several scenes, the writing for female characters in the story could've been strongerI do think Nolan missed a few good opportunities in terms of making this movie a masterpiece, but the acting by all the actors, the special effects and the story will be remembered by many viewers for years to come."
"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped."
For me this movies is the best movie in this decade and one of the best nolan movie ever seen and one of the best movies of the all time actually this movis is top 5 movie I ever seen cillian is the best and deserve oscar and oppenhimer deserve oscar for best picture and cinematography and music and moreRobert downey jr deserve oscar for best supporting actor and also matt damon is one of the best I only say this movie is masterpiece and nolan should win oscar for the best director in this year and he deserve and florence pugh deserves oscar for the best actress in this year I love this movie I won't see this movie againThank you for reading.
"I consider something masterpiece when it does not let you doubt for a second. The watching experience itself should be so absorbing that you don't even see any shortcomings. Yes later you might think of few. That is what this film is. It totally catches your attention, there is no flashy Hollywood sci-fi, action nothing. It is simple story narrated with excellence. Don't believe all those mocking reviews which say you need to know physics for this, absolutely not. Basic knowledge of science is enough and you get the context of stuff going on but yes you need to pay attention. Don't put your mind on those free refill popcorns and drinks. Narration is really tight. Performances are excellent. Background music as always for Nolan - awesome. I am giving 9 only because I was expecting more from the character of Emily Blunt, she is a wonderful actress, my concern is with the character, it could have been explored little more."
"Oppenheimer is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction and Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer bring history to life with an intense and emotionally charged performance. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, seamlessly transporting the audience to the World War II era. The intricate storytelling delves into the complexities of Oppenheimer's life, showcasing his brilliance as a scientist and the moral dilemmas he faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. Thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating, Oppenheimer challenges viewers to reflect on the consequences of scientific discoveries. The supporting cast's performances are outstanding, adding depth and nuance to this profound narrative. In all aspects, Oppenheimer is a triumph that leaves a lasting impact, reminding us of the power of cinema to enlighten and inspire."
"For me this movie doesn't do anything. The acting is good but that is the only thing that is likeable. There is simply nothing interesting (for me that is) about this movie.There aren't any beautiful shots or suspenseful parts. If there was anything happening then the long runtime would have been fine but now it feels like a chore to sit through.You already know the outcome of making the atomic bomb and you already know America was the first to use one. The only new information about the man for me was the part about his personal life but it wasn't anything to write about apart from making the A bomb, and that is not enough to make a movie about.Once again, my opinion, maybe I am not seeing something about this that others did see. Or I simply do not get it."
"I can't express enough how absolutely phenomenal this movie is. It will stand the test of time and will possibly go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made.The movie is three hours long and at no point does it lose your attention. Cillian Murphy should, and probably will, get nominated for an Oscar. And he probably will get it. I don't want to spoil anything, but from the practical visual effects, to every single performance, every aspect of this movie is inspiring. I saw it the weekend it came out and will be buying the blu-ray as soon as it is released.I would also like to add that Robert Downey Jr. Should also be nominated for an Oscar because he absolutely nailed his performance in every way possible. I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. Me, my wife, and my 19 year old son were all completely blown away."
"This is a love letter to science and scientists. At times it reminded me of the recurrent joke in ""The Big Bang Theory"" about Howard not being a real scientist since he ""only"" holds a PhD in Engineering. I was a bit disappointed with the sound but it might be an artistic choice. Do words, does dialogue really matter when you are retelling how the fear of violence from one side pushed the other to unleash the most deadly and brutal attack on Japan. This is a well written movie though the ending is disappointingly cliche for a Nolan screenplay. Around the two hour mark. It felt like it was getting boring. It might benefit from some cuts. I would recommend it in a double bill with ""Hiroshima Mon Amour""."
"Oppenheimer is not solely based on the Trinity. It's entirely political drama. Just a reminder to the audience of how obsessed humans are with power and fame. Music is the true hero of Oppenheimer's film. Every highest point throughout the film causes enormous tension. Everyone did an excellent job. The visual grandeur of Trinity underwhelmed me, but the music helped to compensate. Nolan has once again demonstrated his ability to present a political drama. Where all of the mental state were handled flawlessly. Overall, a remarkable image and historical significance that should never be forgotten. The film will leave you speechless."
"With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck."
"Boring movie, which is mostly political court room scenes.They don't show the Japan bombing but probably because we were ment to see it from oppenheimer's point of view, to which I found the Trinity scene very underwhelming, looks like they just blowed up a big barrel of gasoline. Some unnecessary nude Florence Pugh scenes, which is quite unusual for Nolan.The acting was excellent. But there is too much dialogue and characters being introduced every scene.The part where he is supposed to speak Dutch in Leiden, Netherlands, is not the Dutch language at all. Sounded more like German. Overall 3/10, the movie could have been shorter."
"All These great work by nolan in the past..The casting was great but the screen play was too dry..I literally feel asleep in the 2nd half. Never ever in my life felt asleep in theatre..It should he considered as a documentary of robert j oppenheimer..It's not an movie.The poster is too good for what i saw on screen..
There is drama but everything is just vocal..It didn't connect me as an audience .. It just keeps on going and going. The scene didn't evoke any emotional reaction.I went to see it with such high hope. It just felt like cheated to me as an nolan fan .This surely is over hyped and over rated."
"Firstly, I am not a Nolan fan. That means I will not overrate and exagerate his averagely good films. Oppenheimer is a great historical drama not because of its directing but because of its interstellar casting from Downey Jr. To Malek, from Pough to Blunt or From Damon to Affleck. Not to mention Murphy who underacts just perfectly. Just wow... Even extras are famous in this movie...Editing and soundtrack are the two other significant reasons of Oppenheimer's success. Nolan is and was always surrounded with great crew members and post staff. His directing or lack of directing can never keep up with his unique imagination and writing skills.Go watch this movie because it is an epic Historical Drama not because Nolan fanboys said so... capiche?"
"Christopher Nolan can be immensely proud of the overall performances of all of his cast in 'Oppenheimer', however a certain Mr Murphy, stands out.From the get go, the film sets the tempo of which Nolan is known for - you're hanging on the edge of your seat, sweating and gripping the handles. We all know the eventual outcome of the science that goes on in this film but it really does make you think 'what if'... the risks taken to proceed with the project were straight insanity.Nolan needs to stick to this era, he smashed it with 'Dunkirk' and now 'Oppenheimer' continues a great trend. Perhaps Nolan could next venture into the Vietnam war or even WW1?Must see movie!!"
"This movie touched every base and was very well written. It answered so many questions I've had even after visiting the museum several times and with my husband working for the labs himself, I'm even more proud and astonished at all of the history Los Alamos has given. Very interesting, brilliant and sad.The acting was so good. They had film tents set up in the center of town and no way did I think the graphics like the house or buildings would look so much like the 40's.Much effort and thought was put into this film and it's honestly refreshing to see a good movie.10/10 would own on dvd and would watch again!"
"Oppenheimer is by no small margin the most profound movie I've ever seen. It is no exaggeration to say that this film is a work of genius. Not just on part of the directing and screenplay, but interestingly enough, the editing. In a 3-hour movie, there wasn't a single wasted frame. The editing and sound design played such pivotal roles in the film in adding layers of depth beyond even the script and dialogue. I never thought I'd see a movie that has quite literally no action whatsoever but never-the-less never a dull moment. Every scene is pertinent, every line explosive and powerful. Featuring one of the most star-studded casts I've ever seen (I recognized every actor in the movie) giving the performances of their lifetimes, I strongly suspect everyone from the director, editor, writer, composer to the majority of the cast will receive tons of well-deserved accolades for this feature. I went in expecting it to be very good and very powerful. I came out experiencing a masterpiece of cinema, one I'm likely never to forget."
"Best Cinematic Movie of 2023 and OSCAR NOMINATED 2024. Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this."
"This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like C. Nolan. I also really liked this movie. The movie is told from Oppenheimer's point of view. I think it was fine. Some scientific topics were very difficult to understand for me. I think the bomb scene was good. I think the acting was very good. Cillian Murphy played the static, cold character very well. Robert Downey Jr. Played great too. I think tacting was generally so good. I think there were some boring scenes in the movie. There were scenes in the cinema where I started to sleep out of boredom. But overall, I think it deserves an ""8"" point. This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like it. I also watched the other movie (pink movie) first. It was so good after that movie."
"I was really taken by it. It is 3 hrs long but time flies fast when you watch it. Interesting, complelling and not too hard to follow but yeah you have to concentrate with all the dfferent names on scientists etc... A very strong biopic. Great actors. Gary Oldman, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon and many more. I would say Robert Downey Jr is the big star in this movie, but of course Cilian Murphy is magnetic too. I usually go for more relationship-oriented movies with strong psychological portaits so I was a little bit hesitant about this one. Action, Nolan.... not my cup of tea... I had my prejudies! But it's one cinematic experience and it is worth all the hype, unlike the Barbie movie."
"Nolan wastes none of the viewers time in throwing you into J. Robert Oppenheimer's world. Epic masterpiece. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are the standouts. Along with Hoytema's cinematography and Göranssons spine-shaking score. The use of the black and white IMAX film is masterful. Although it is three hours, so, make sure your attention span is long and your brain is switched on. Pacing thought was not an issue due to the unbelievable tension. Nolan may just beat his ""not being able to write characters"" allegations. Though Oppenheimer is a real human which makes it easier. Watch this."
"I was very excited to watch Oppenheimer for a long time and it didn't disappoint. It's very interesting and overwhelming film from the start to the end I enjoyed every single second of it and all the details, and I really liked the acting of the characters like Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. And it is in my top 10 or actually my top five favorite movies of all time the storyline was amazing and everything connected very well. It seems like a story, and I know it's based on a true story. It was very, very good. I thetic of the film was very old money, and I didn't know how to explain it, but it was very luxury in a way that I like it, and the science was like another story like it was very interesting, and the quantum physics and theories was very interesting, and how Oppenheimer was feeling guilty about his own doing, and everything makes sense and they just got the feeling that they got in interstellar that's all top five favorite movies of all time."
"If this film don't win Nolan an Oscar, I'm not sure what will!Brilliant acting, loud and magnificent soundtrack, and the mesmerizing end scene. All of these factors are undoubtedly amazing.""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves audiences captivated and moved. The film brilliantly portrays the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. With stellar performances, compelling storytelling, and stunning visuals, it delves into the complexities of science, ethics, and human nature. A must-watch for history buffs and anyone seeking thought-provoking cinema. Truly an unforgettable experience! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Not your typical Nolan pic but that's a good thing.Beautifully acted and shot. Fantastically expansive and engaging. Saw it in IMAX though it was not necessary. Wonderfully cinematic score. Love the use of percussion.Highly recommended for history, cinephiles, and Nolan fans. I predict accolades all around and if this doesn't sweep awards season I would be SHOCKED.Fun fact, no CGI. Everything is practical affects. The film is long (3 hours) so choose your breaks in the first hour.Wonderfully surprised by the political story as well. I had no idea. Nolan did a great job of making him human and not judging."
"At least 30 minutes could be cut without losing any of the story. The time jumps are confusing, though not as frenetic as in Dunkirk. The story is interesting, and the acting is well done. The film fails the Bechdel test in every way, and is in that regard an anti-Barbie. There are a few female characters, but they only exist to expound the story of men. Kitty especially should have been featured more, rather than a crabby and bitter shell. Why was she so miserable? We can imagine, but would've been great to see her story.The weirdest thing they did was leave Murphy's double pierced ear visible in multiple closeup scenes. It was distracting and easily fixable."
"The result is important, but that's about it and e all already know that. The story is boring and the movie is the most pretentious thing I have seen in a long time. I get it, the result is a big deal, probably the biggest deal known to human kind. But the movie isn't telling me anything I don't already know nor is it making it seem interesting but oh boy it sure is trying. It's sad cause Cillian has been one of my favorite actors. But the movie seems like a whole movie saying ""this is important and we are important people telling you how important this is"". We get it. Was looking forward to this WAY more than Barbie, but honestly Barbie wins. Im fighting hard to stay awake for the second half.....GOD THE SECOND HALF! I have to go back in now, let's see if I can do it."
"Oppenheimer is an enthralling character drama concerning the life of Robert Oppenheimer and all of the politics, challenges, and nuances that surrounded his work on the atomic bomb. Aside from an at times thrilling score to make otherwise relatively non-thrilling conversation between characters elevated, the film does not have any big dopamine moments aside from the detonation. All of this said, I was absolutely captivated the entire time. It is important to make this distinction because those with less... refined, attention spans may find it a near impossible task to tolerate 3 hours of this dialogue heavy film. I wish I could have experienced this in 70mm IMAX but digital will have to do."
"A movie that has a poetic description of the life of Robert Oppenheimer. When you do a favour for your own country, but not for the humanity. "" No good deed goes unpunished"".A tragic story of a man questions his morality in order to serve his country, and ""for the greater good"". However, the questioning haunted Oppenheimer that led him to try to encourage governments to stop building World Mass Destruction. But its too late, humanity are doomed by their own creation. Humanity are destined to have blood in their hands ""for their own good"".Plot : 10/10
Directing :10/10
Characters: 9/10
Cinematography: 10/10
Overall: 9.75/10."
This movie was a pure display of art. Every scene was extremely impactful and suspenseful. It was a long movie but you were intensely driven in the whole time. Cillian Murphy truly captured the character and showing the human side/ moral dilemmas of a man that believe that he gave the world the power to destroy itself was amazing. It showed showed a very real and what felt like very true side to a life alter event that happened in your history and you could feel every bit of that impact in the audience as these decisions were being made. The acting was great for all characters and the ability to give what felt like back stage passes to one of the biggest events in the past century was amazing. It puts very recent events and current events in perspective and gives the audience a lot to talk about and discuss. Well done.
"This is one of the best movies I have seen in my life so far.I have seen it in IMAX format, it was the ride of a lifetime, the effects are spot on, the sounds are terrifying it feels like you are there part of the action of the movie.The pacing is very dynamic and there is a lot to take in as the story progresses. Actors have brought the best in this movie, you forget they are actors and start to believe the existence of the characters.In conclusion this is a must watch movie that will go in history as the best movie ever made in this decade.My recommendation is to watch it in IMAX, for the best experience."
"If you somehow still didn't know Cillian Murphy before watching this film, you'll most certainly never forget him after you've finished. This man has been brilliant in every role he's performed in, but what he accomplished in this film is nothing short of perfection. Christopher Nolan remains the greatest director / filmmaker on the planet, and it's not even close. With the already incredible catalogue he's given us, this just might be his best yet. He makes a 3 hour film feel as if only half an hour has passed. The tension, the love, the scenery, the heartbreak, and the terror.....I mean, it's all there.""It's not for you. It's for them.""My heart hurts just thinking of that line.Bravo."
"I for one can not understand how christopher nolan fools studio executives into giving him money to produce so many terrible films. If they would only give more money to the sound crew, they might not turn the bass subwoofer & one note drone volumes up to 11 & the dialogue down to 2, so that no one has a clue of what is being said or going on.Every screening of this over long, 3 hour bass boosted dross should have sub-titled. You'd think lessons would've been learned from tenet & his previous movies but obviously not.I wish someone else would've made a coherent telling of such an important man & his story.2/10."
"Oppenheimer Review: Very good movie, but be forewarned: it's long (3 hours) and very dialogue-heavy. People who aren't interested in history, who are distracted very easily, and who expect a lot of action will be disappointed. Every movie-making and storytelling aspect hit the mark. The cinematography, the musical score, the depth of characterization were all good. I only have one criticism, which is that the jumbled chronology of scenes made it kind of confusing for someone who wasn't paying attention or for someone who didn't have a basic knowledge of the story. However, the black and white shots coupled with the various location settings helped with this. Overall, an excellent film with a very important message: History is made by flawed and complicated people, who sometimes do bad things for good reasons, which can have both rewarding and terrible effects."
"I originally gave this a 9 because I struggle to give something a 10 but I honestly can't think of a single thing that could be improved or done better. The casting, the editing, the acting, the sound, the pacing... I can't think of a single thing wrong with any of these.For anyone who is put off by the runtime, I watched Indiana Jones a week prior to seeing Oppenheimer and although Oppenheimer is just a little bit longer, Indiana Jones was an absolute endurance test to sit through, in comparison. Every second of Oppenheimer feels pivotal to the experience and I almost wasn't ready for it to end.I don't want to say too much because a million other reviews have said it many times over but this is absolutely one of the most incredible film experiences you could ever hope to have and gives me huge faith that real film making isn't dead."
"Nolan rarely does empathy well but this is a soulless three hours of men mumbling at one another. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are wasted and portrayed as damaged souls. Scenes come and go barely registering on your conscience. Watching this movie is a bit like thinking back to you time in school where you were forced by your teachers to watch educational videos which were kind of okay but you'd rather be playing Lego or riding your bike. That's what watching Oppenheimer is like. It's like a three hour lecture with a bit of sex thrown in. Yes, it's a competent artistic film but that doesn't mean it's that good."
"Oppenheimer is a great film. The cast is stellar , the cinematography is top notch, and the sound editing might be the most underrated aspect of all. The theme of annihilation associated with the nuclear arms race still resonate today. The only issue was the running time of 3 hours. I felt the film could have been just as effective if it shaved off about 45 minutes. There is a lot of time devoted to a hearing to determine whether Oppenheimer gets to retain his security clearance. This may be an effective way to tell a story but the stakes of the ""trial"" never felt that high. Similarly there is confirmation hearing for the Secretary of Commerce played by Robert Downey Jr. That is simply not very interesting when compared to the high stakes development and testing of the nuclear bomb."
"Christopher Nolan has done it again with his latest release of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the Atom bomb. Now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of Oppenheimer. Those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed. I really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that Nolan used zero CGI shots in this film. This star studded movie showcases some amazing Oscar worthy performances from all of it's Leads with Cillian Murphy, Roberty Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt. Even the smaller roles bring all of their A games. I got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm Imax and when I say this is truly how Nolan wanted you to see it as intended, I mean it. The movie was breathtaking and such an important film to see in this day in age. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer gets a perfect 10 out of 10 for me. Also I would rank it as one of Nolan's best films ever!"
"This is the film that cements Christopher Nolan as one of the best contemporary directors working as well as one of the best to ever make movies. From the moment the film starts, it hits the ground running and never lets up. It knows exactly what pace it wishes to set for three hours. There are even moments where you may not be 100% percent sure what is happening, but rest assured it all comes together. See it on the biggest screen you can find. I cannot wait to see this again because I'm sure there are parts that I didn't fully grasp. I might say this is one of the greatest films of all time easily one of the best of the past ten years or so. Go see it - now......"
"If you're going into this movie with the expectation of being entertained by lots of explosions, comedy, and filler screen time, you will be disappointed. This is a visual story. Its very intellectually created & exceptionally well timed out. Given that it's a 3 hour movie it does a wonderful job allowing the viewer to build a relationship with the main character to fully understand Oppeinheimers trials and tribulations and to understand what motivated him & shaped what would later become his viewpoint on the entire creation of the atomic bomb and overall criticism of the US Military's decisions. Another 10/10 for C. Nolan!"
"In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life."
"This is the first ever IMDB review that I write because I need to give this movie my stars. The camera work is amazing. The cast is amazing and the story is even better. The only downside was the fast pacing wich you may see as a positive thing and the use op a lot of different names for characters. The use of those names was somethimes a little confusing but it does not really affect the story as it is always clear after some thime who they are referring to. Me and my friend just sat there in the cinema after the movie was done. Both baffeled by what happend and the ending. I got goosebumps 3 times from some moments in the movie, never had that before in my life. I have read some negative reviews wich say it was boring.... The only thing they think is not boring is dangeling from a thin wire above a 30meter drop or something but this movie was not even close to boring."
"The acting was amazing, the cinematography was also amazing, but thats where the good ends and the bad starts. 3 hours are you kidding me? This story could have been done in an hour forty-five with credits. There was too much filler garbage i was immediately annoyed. Glorifying the smartest people creating the biggest bomb after the worlds best scientific discovery was sickening. I know that was true, but it made me sick. Showing how twisted and demented our government is was a great idea. There is literally too many things i want to say but don't know how to word them. I highly recommend everyone see something else and save a lot of time. Watch this at home after it hits netflix."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this breathtaking political thriller (which, in my opinion, is mistakenly marketed as psychological horror movie)! As a form, it is very close to Nolan's 'The Prestige.' The rivalry gradually unfolds, and at the end, we get the whole picture. Best suited for those who have some interest and understanding of the development of Physics during World War II and the political scenario of America at that time. And if you are a lover of good old style drama and Christopher Nolan's work, I think that three hours runtime is not too long for a story of this scale! The story material has potential for a mini-series as well."
"Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end."
"Christopher Nolan is a genius. The pacing, the cinematography and the acting all coming together for quite the spectacle. Oppenheimer much like the man is a complex, layered movie. I found that the non-linear storytelling really worked for me and it helped heighten the moments of tension. I really liked the choice of only showing the Trinity Test and not the actual bombings, and the consequences of developing and dropping those bombs. The last hour of the movie and especially the last few minutes before the credits roll are haunting and will sit with you.Cillian Murphy is just amazing. I have always been such a fan of his acting and I am glad he's getting his flowers by being recognized for this role. Robert Downey Jr was chilling as Lewis Strauss. He has successfully shed his much loved but campy Iron Man role and has reminded us all that he is a fantastic actor. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were also good to watch. And the many surprising cameos."
"For the first time I watch a 3 hour's documentary without getting bored for a single minute. This movie is a must watch, The story is more than amazing and the cast got the job done. Outstanding performance from each actor on the movie.Christopher Nolan did all the things that make this movie be one of the top rated movies in all histories.Trust me on this that the income of this movie will cross the 500 Million.A must watch movie and I completely recommend it to anyone even if you don't like documentaries trust me that you will like this one and you will enjoy the 3 hours in it.Thank you guys for this Masterpiece."
"So Oppenheimer didn't disappoint. Prepare for a relentlessly tense three hour investment with ample exposition and borderline horror tropes. Also prepare for a Titanic-style treasure trove of Oscars come award season. Cillian already has one hand on his statue, while Nolan will surely take home Best Film and Director. Downey might also sneak a Best Supporting. But the true master here is Ludwig Goransson, whose score ensures the exposition is never boring, amping up the tension to unbearable levels of dread. Couldn't believe it wasn't Hans Zimmer when I looked it up. Add the unbelievable sound mix and Oppenheimer is terrifyingly unsettling. It has all the hallmarks of classic docudramas like JFK and 13 Days, with MTV editing and time jumps, but is a superior film that must be seen on a big screen, preferably IMAX. Awesome 10/10."
Christopher Nolan never again disappoints me with all the films he made. But this one is the real deal. Give this man an award for best picture and best director and screenplay. Give Cillan Murphy an award for best actor in leading role. I saw give everyone that worked very hard well on this masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is all I can for everyone who is a big fan of Christopher Nolan films. The IMAX 70MM MUST SURVIVE AND PREVAIL. It is better to watch the film in the best IMAX 70MM FORMAT POSSIBLE. No one and I meant no has ever witnessed this film before.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"A spectacular film, one of the best motion pictures that was ever shot. The soundtrack of the movie was insane, it is three hours but you don't feel it because it is exciting from the start till the end, the cast was amazing, everyone of them did his role with perfect performance. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job directing Oppenheimer. The way he tells the story of doctor Robert was fantastic, they were able to make everyone in the theater so excited throughout the movie which is mainly focusing on politics without any action scenes and that's really incredible. I believe that this movie is the best cinema experience in history."
"Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this."
"Exceptional. One of Christopher Nolan's best movies. The cinematography is immaculate. The scenes are so crisp and intricate; can't believe they didn't use CGI. The cast, Cillian Murphy in particular, deserves an Oscar for that performance. In my opinion, the supporting roles of RDJ and Emily Blunt are also Oscar worthy, not to mention the spectacular portrayal by Matt Damon. The pacing, characters, cinematography, soundtrack, and story line exceeds expectations. This accurately paints a vivid picture of Oppenheimer's life and who he was. I think this film has a very good chance of being nominated and winning best picture at the Oscars next year. Go watch it on the biggest screen possible. A movie you won't regret seeing."
"""Oppenheimer"" may be the greatest biopic I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan has struck gold again. The film is beautiful, terrifying, and leaves you thinking after the credits roll. The acting in this film is amazing. Cillian Murphy shines in the spotlight and deserves a nod at best actor, and Robert Downey jr. Puts on one of if not the greatest performance of his career. The practical effects are stunning, and brings to life the horror of an atomic bomb. The score is masterful portraying the right themes in the perfect moments. This film needs to be seen by everyone and on the biggest screen possible."
"It's a great movie ... it's not just about him making US nuclear power & world war 2 .., it's more about the human aspect , the way he was thinking after nagasaki and hiroshima attacks.It's a combination of brilliant actor Cilian Murphy & Genius director Christopher Nolan🔥🔥
For me it's a Movie Of The Year.It's a great movie ... it's not just about him making US nuclear power & world war 2 .., it's more about the human aspect , the way he was thinking after nagasaki and hiroshima attacks.It's a combination of brilliant actor Cilian Murphy & Genius director Christopher Nolan🔥🔥
For me it's a Movie Of The Year."
"One thing I don't like about this movie, there is a scene in this movie when oppenheimer was doing sex with his gf and using Hindu scripture Geeta phrase. If Christopher Nolan known for reality instead of VFX why doesn't he used real video reference and create separate scene for that movie. Before releasing, there was a hype about this movie because of Oppenheimer use the Geeta phrase after dropping the bomb by US army that was a reason, I was curious about to watch this movie but if you are not aware about physics & history, my suggestion for you do some RND first then you can watch this movie otherwise you will going to sleep on the chair. I think director doesn't explain movie so well."
"The movie was amazing, but aren't all of Nolan's films? That's not what I'm hear to talk about though. As an avid movie goer I cannot emphasize how important it is to experience this film in IMAX. I have watched 100's of movies in IMAX and this is hands down the greatest one of all time. I could feel sound and pressure in my chest throughout the film. I was paralyzed in my seat until the final hour of the film.I watched it in my local IMAX theater, which is an amazing theater, but somehow I feel like I still did it a disservice because I didn't watch it in 70mm. Luckily there is one only 200 miles away in Dallas that I purchased a ticket for to see tomorrow.Again, Nolan's movies always have the best acting, cinematography, plots, pacing, etc.... This movie had something else beyond all the others."
"Oppenheimer was a horror drama that shows you how a humankind can destroy the world without thinking of its own kind.It was typical Nolan movie with brilliant cinematography, appealing visuals and BG score.Cillian was outstanding but Robert Downey Jr. Man He was extremely good, probably one of his finest work, loved his acting. Matt Damon also did a good job.It's not just about the invention of a destructive tool but also connect to the human nature how the man himself feels when he realizes what he's done.Nolan was imaginative, clever and at his best, he created a beautiful cinematic MASTERPIECE."
"The movie is incredible. I love how they started from the beginning not just starting at making the a-bom. It was very interesting to watch his life and everything that happened. The visuals and the actors are phenomenal. I already had so much respect for Cillian Murphy, but hell this man can act. He was amazing and I loved RDJ as Strauss and Emily Blunt as Kitty. They were all so good! If you are like me and like your history stuff then you already know how it ends. But even though I knew, my eyes were locked on the screen, I was nervous, I was angry, I was sad, I felt relieved. It was a rollercoaster of emotions and I am glad that I had them. I know this movie isn't for anyone because 3 hours is a long sit, but for me it didn't even feel like 3 hours. I absolutely loved it, best actors, best cinematography, best music, best writing. I can go on forever. Go see this, it's a very interesting and big part of history and an incredible made movie."
"Another masterpiece by Nolan. This is easily one of the best movie in the decade.I couldn't talk about this movie without mentioning the briliant performance by Cillian Murphy. He aced the role to perfection. RDJ and Emily Blunt delivered a great performance as the Patriotic American, Lewis Strauss and Kitty Oppenheimer .Every actor did a great job.Score by Ludwig Göransson was absolutely flawless. It was perfectly able to grasp the tension between scenes. Another great thing about Nolan is , he knows how to use silence and he really made perfect use of the silence in this movie.Overall , this biography drama is a must watch and you should really watch it in the theatres. You will not feel the 3hr period of the Movie."
"In the movie, Oppenheimer is a professor in Leiden, The Netherlands. You can hear him speak 'Dutch' for a class of students, but everyone in our Dutch movie theatre mumbled 'what? What's he saying?' It was a fantasy language, and certainly not Dutch, not even German. I think making a movie about real events requires proper investigation and love for details. Therefore we thought it was irritating that the actor and director didn't check this scene with Dutchies. The movie was very long and there were lots of characters and names you had to remember, but the general warning and impact of human destruction power and balances of power was very clear and very frightening. The uncertainty whether the bomb would destroy the complete atmosphere, and that they took that risk: man, one day we will really destroy earth, one way or the other."
"The only thing that kept me from giving this film a 9 instead of an 8 is the length. Not much shorter than the actual war. The directing was excellant and the cast is superb. The only one I had a small problem with was the choice for President Truman. I think in real life Truman was gruffer. Other than that, everyone was right on. I believe the story line was fairly accurate as was the locations. I strongly recommend seeing this film, if you can sit for 3 hours. So, pack a lunch, put your feet up and enjoy. I think you will not feel cheated and certainly not happy and upbeat but very informed."
"""Wow"" - My exact sentiment as soon as the credits rolled. Nolan is truly a master film maker, this movie truly was an experience to be had only in the cinema.Oppenheimer really is a biopic, and anyone expecting a war movie or some kind of action packed film is sorely mistaken. This is an insight into the incredible mind of a man tasked with a truly ardous dilemma or life and death.It's easy on the eyes, food for thought and no doubt will be hailed as a timeless classic. Cillian is so brilliant in this role, I couldn't praise him any higher, he deserves an award for this portrayal, easily.For a 3 hour long movie, it was fast paced and at no point was I bored."
"Oppenheimer is something else entirely and what makes it so fascinating is that it's so hard to distinguish what it really is. Christopher Nolan's latest and greatest masterwork is a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance. Achieving a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavour and ambition. The tour-de-force performances are matched only by its ear-blistering musical soundscape by Ludwig Göransson, Oppenheimer is a destructive force to be reckoned with, although I'm still peeved Universal didn't let Nolan detonate an actual nuclear bomb for Trinty."
"This movie is worth the whole hype. The acting is phenomenal, Cillian Murphy was outstanding and how the history construct is amazing.I though the 3h duration would make the movie tiring but you are attached to the narrative the whole time, the way characters are constructed and the time plots are really well done. The movie also shows many psychological and political aspects from the time and from the characters that can be easily brought to the present, it criticizes the extremism in the duality of our current political scenario.Definitely we will expect some Oscar nominations for Oppenheimer."
"Even though I'm not all that attached to the story, the way the film portrays the complex emotions of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"" is fascinating. It gives audiences like us the freedom to interpret the identity of Oppy through the perspectives of him and the people around his life. Even though the film is mainly told from the Destroyer of Worlds's point of view, one can't help but think accordingly: in fact, What kind of person does he see himself as?This is the most different Nolan's flavor. Heavy politics, lots of dialogue, and a little bit of time-shifting narrative. It's a pity that I didn't have a chance to watch it in IMAX. Apart from the visuals, the sound in the normal theater is also not satisfying enough for me.I'm not that much into it, but still, this is one of the finest films of the year."
"I had a high expectation for this one since not only Chris Nolan is directing but also my favourite actor Cillian is playing the lead role. When I watched this film those expectations were not only met but also exceeded. You really get into the head of Oppenheimer in the film. This one really is more about Oppenheimer than it is about the atomic bomb. This movie even though 3 hours long, will not keep you away. It has kept me engaged throughout. Editing, dialogues, cinematography and especially acting are on top. There is no questioning about Nolan's direction. That detonation scene though, it is hard to put it in words. I mean you have to experience it in big screens. I am glad watched this in IMAX. Absolutely brilliant. For me this is the BEST FILM EVER MADE."
"The whole movie I was wondering how it couldn't possibly have any CGI in it.Seeing the Trinity test in theaters was the best choice, it's too beautiful, surprising and with a lot of tension. It made me think how terrifying a third world war with those kinds of weapons would be.I loved Cilian Murphy's performance, I could feel the problems happening in his mind, but making clear Nolan's excellent direction.There were many dialogue scenes, but then they put many more dialogue scenes with an exquisite soundtrack and performances that caused my eyes to open even more.Unbelievably I was left wanting more, I want to see more!!!!"
"Oppenheimer is a wonderful, immaculate film-a beautifully crafted, powerful story chronicling the human impact of its historical events. It's full of character and tension.The only thing keeping it from a 10/10 is that Josh Peck, our beloved god-king, only had 4 lines of dialogue in the film.If they had given him a larger role, expanded his character's backstory, perhaps given him a sex scene, and allowed our master to showcase his unmatched talent and glory, then perhaps Nolan's latest film could have reached its coveted masterpiece status.But, as it stands, it's a pretty great film with not enough Josh Peck."
I will definitely going to watch it again on IMAX when I get the chance as this is some high quality story telling. The movie is worth the hype created before the release.Cillian Murphy did an exceptional job and no one will gonna surprise if he gets the Oscar for it.Robert Downey also steals the show whenever he got a chance to do his job. Emily and Florence did their part however small it was but impact will remain.The music shines in this movie in every frame. You will definitely feel the music going through your veins with the scene and that's brilliance of Nolan and his team. This is a 💎 gem.
"Everything about this film is top notch: acting, lighting, sound, dialogue, everything worked perfectly telling a very technical and detailed story. Well done.There were no small parts in the film. Every character was integral to the story. I see multiple award nominations and wins for this great cast. Cillian Murphy is wonderful in the lead role and his portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer has you believing at times your watching a documentary. I have been a Robert Downey Jr fan for a vey long time and this was probably his greatest performance.I am usually not a big fan of jumping around multiple timelines but this film was so well done it worked to perfection."
"This movie is like solid 8 but really not easy to understand. There are several layers like politics, moral, family, history, science and if you want to get the full experience you might need to be like 60-70 years old professor from US who has vivid interest in politics and is really open-minded. Seriously, I was prepared although not falling into this category but most of the audience I think did not understand a lot as they were too young and politically fragile. And that is not even touching the morals of the story or ancient history mentioned briefly. Or consequences for the Japanese that were so terrible. Go there, watch and come back to this movie in 10-15 years again if you are under 45."
"For a three hour film, it still proved not enough time to cover any part of his life with enough time to explore. Music all the way through the film which at times made me struggle to hear what was being said. Also felt that some scenes would have played better without music. Due to what felt like a rush to complete so many strands of his life, I never felt connected or to understand the man. A great cast but a film I would not watch again. I was never bored but it just did not have any emotional impact which surprised me. I am not a fan of nolan's previous film Tenet either. Three hours felt more like a rush job and was, in my opinion, average."
"Powerful. Sublime. All this adjectives used for this movie are absolutely right. The double plot in this movie works really well, and the cuts between scenes showed us perfectly what time it really was. The cinematography resonates with the weightiness of the subject, weaving a visual tapestry of awe. And, of course, let us not forget the exceptional brilliance of every actor and actress, each breathing life into their characters with sheer marvel. A masterpiece and a future classic for sure.Synopsis:
During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history."
"After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art. Nolan's seamless transitions between different periods in history not only keep the narrative engaging but also provide a deeper understanding of the characters and the historical events surrounding them. It's a brilliant storytelling technique that keeps you hooked from start to finish."
"The best drama ever witnessed, one of the best dramatic experience . Its Nolan's masterpiece, every scene written is a master piece every dialogue, every screenplay has been crafted soo good. Cilian murphy who has just nailed with his performances, he just lived the character of oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is gem in the field of physics and atomic matter. He is soft and introvert which has been portrayed so perfect by murphy, i hope he gets an oscar for his performance in Oppenheimer. All others robert downey, emily , matt and pugh all did their supporting roles to perfect. Especially the strauss role played by our former iron man robert downey jr was world class, hope he gets an oscar too. A special recognition to the music , its the pillar to the movie, soo pure and different and really makes as feel , an ultra realistic experience. Overall an osm drama experience, a complete nolan film with cuts in. Please do watch in theaters."
"The film lays out a journey of humanity's character that which we've never recovered. Powerful evils are perpetrated by such noble ""idealism"" from either side & the ""good"" versus evil debates remain only for the winners to portray the virtues of their side. It's a sickening gut wrenching film of such unimaginable horrors behinds it's subject matter of 2 dropped bombs never explained nor given detail. Only by the films very existence will humanity have yet another example of humankind's ""art"" ego telling war horror for entertainment, no idealism, no whimsical warnings, instead this seems instead a truth. Our very worst imaginings are only outdone by those with the power & ego to forgo their soul to achieve anything for nothing but horror. :Macbeth Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow...."
"I would just like as an amateur to express my deepest sympathy for this movie, the purpose, the meaning, the goal and the courage to present complexity, politics and history to disinterested young people, wich unfortunately seem to go deeper and deeper to the futile ignorance of existing in comfort. This is a complex watch, does not align with modern culture and doesn't fear truth, it is not made for masses or public popularity.It is made primarily for the artist who makes it to people, so being him the first person to watch, it is made in the image of the artist himself not the people wich he will profit with.It is for people that seek the good old movie that grows their intellect and does not feed them with propaganda, yes I'm calling out for Barbie.Deeply grateful for this breath of fresh air in a saturated industry."
"If this was not a Christopher Nolan movie, it would not even be noticed. It's hard to understand also why this movie would need to be seen in an IMAX theatre. It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies. One gets the impression that this movie is getting the attention it does because of the history of its maker, but not on the merit of its own performance. The hype is definitely over done on this one. There was some decent acting, especially from Downey Jr. And Damon."
"This movie brings people to life! This movie made me feel like I was part of the whole story! If you go and watch it, please watch it in IMAX, cause the whole movie brings everything in the whole industry in prospective! I loved the performance of every single one of the actors/actresses and I think the whole cast is chosen precisely and perfect for the whole movie's context! I loved the whole history lesson lol, but I loved the most the thought of our scary world that we live in! We have to think more about the people in the world, than ourselves and other opinions and the light of the projectors! Go and watch it! You won't regret it!"
"One of the most anticipated movies, because of the man behind it, happent to know the story before going into movie. Frankly, the movie feels stretched, wanted to just leave the theatre about 2 hrs in, but stayed in respect of those 2 hrs. Legal proceedings just such a bore, shouldn't have been given this much significance, just flooded the movie, also I wasn't confident about where his wife's motivation comes from. For the first time ever I noticed this style of movie making that is present in this movie actually bothers me. Whole movie divided into 5-10 seconds scenes, what is it Mr. Nolan, don't trust your viewers to have longer attention spans?"
"2 hours of bloated, dull storytelling with one hour of decent story. So many celebrity cameos that it was distracting and took you out of the story every time. Everyone clearly wants the chance to cameo in a Nolan film.Nolan needs a hard edit. 3 hours of time I'll never get back. There is a trend of these self important movies thst don't know quite where to find the story.For all the men claiming that barbie wasn't kind enough to men, there's plenty here for you. A parade of white men, not a single interesting woman character. And they did Florence Pugh dirty, with unnecessary nude scenes. She deserves better."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer may be the most expertly crafted and intelligent movie I've seen in the past decade. The scope of the film was ambitious, but if there's anyone that can do it, it's Christopher Nolan. The visuals are almost all practical and it pays off, this movie is stunning to look at from the first frame to its last. The cinematography also plays a part in this. The cast, acting, and dialogue are all perfectly selected, acted, and written. Specifically, the acting from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh are all phenomenal. The pacing is fantastic though once you get to the court scenes towards the end of the movie it can drag a little, but it's nothing drastic The message of the movie being ""just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should"" is perfect for Robert Oppenheimer's story. The movie is great in IMAX just like Nolan promised, though I don't believe it is necessary to get the full experience of the movie like he said. The reality is, I don't see any obvious negatives to this film so this is a rare 10 out of 10 movie for me, and I hope everyone gets to go see it."
"I'm not especially into biopics - the stories are formulaic by nature, and executing the beginning/ending is never easy (which usually means the middle suffers as a result). ""Genius encounters challenges and overcomes"" can only be so interesting. Enter Christopher Nolan, who uses ALL his tricks to make this film something more than just Oppenheimer's life. And it works. The editing, the time jumps, the sense of chaos, the awe-inspiring cinematography...it all adds stakes over and over. The first two hours just rocketed by. By the time they strapped on their goggles, I was somehow on the edge of my seat for a bomb test with a fairly predictable outcome. The third act dragged a bit, but this was still quite a feat. It's not my favorite Nolan film, but it felt like a maybe the fullest expression of his filmmaking. And I'm glad someone is making movies like this."
"It is a very great movie in all respects. I watched it on the imax screen. It was something dazzling throughout the 3 hours. I did not feel bored or look at the clock at all. The acting was very beautiful and also, for sure, the directing was very great. The dialogues that were present throughout the film were beautiful and had a strong meaning and presence in the story. It is not present in vain. I expect that I will watch it in the cinema more than once during this period. It is one of the most beautiful works that I have seen during the past two years and deservedly deserves the Oscar in many aspects."
"Every character well developed and human, not cookie cutter 'cut outs' or stereotyped by race, religion or profession. Attention to detail in every respect IE the images are stunning . Production design , IE sequence of events and the acting and direction could not be better. Oh . . . A script developed by the Film MakeR from . . . A . . . BooK ; in other words good writing. Human drama taken from real life can be more dramatic and interesting than fictional scripts. IMO the film is 1) a stunning achievement and 2) very much worth the three hour length to see it. You won't find yourself saying , 'this movie is too long' as so many are these days. My one warning and criticism is that in some scenes the dialogue is not even intelligible due to so much other sound in the back round. Highly recommended otherwise.And please , as always , remember to ignore the 'one and done' 'reviewers' here."
"Absolutely brilliant portrayal of, well, everything. The powerful mental battles are the best ever place on screen. The music adds to this experience in a way that has never hit you this hard. And I mean HIT. Physical sound is incredible. Any movies that makes your smart watch tell you to calm down it's worth watching.The sex scenes actually add to the movie but they are not sensual.Try and see this on the largest screen possible. With the loudest sound you can get.The time goes past very fast. It is not a burden. It really does not feel that long. Have a large drink nearby and make sure you empty your bladder."
"This movie is like if Terrence Mallick remade interstellar. It feels like the worse Nolan movie from a major studio. Watching it gave the experience of watching a three hour trailer. The non-linear storyline was interesting, and the movie is beautiful from a technical filmmaking standpoint but the story felt tired. The majority of the acting performances are top notch, with one exception, Emily Blunt, bless her heart is very inconsistent and stands out as the bottom of this illustrious class. By the end of the film I was waiting for the end card and this longing was not helped by the all too common terrible theater educate."
"I have no worldly idea who is giving this film mega stars!!!!????? The film has so many flaws; the number one being the star-studded (NOT) cast! Did everyone take downers before shooting the scenes? I've never experienced such a boring film with so many quality actors. Dear Lord! Also, the writing was messed up! Some of it was technical but most of it was fluffy and watered down. There is no personality in any of the characters. The topic itself is so interesting but not anymore!!! You could not ruin a film anymore. And the black and white scenes are ridiculous. No real reason for that. It looks weird and feels weird. Finally, Cillian, I still love you but this isn't your role."
"Oppenheimer is a captivating masterpiece that skillfully combines drama, history, and humanity. With stunning cinematography, powerful performances, exceptional score and sound design, and thought-provoking storytelling, it immerses viewers in the complex world of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film explores his personal journey, from leading the Manhattan Project to grappling with the moral implications of his scientific breakthrough. It raises profound questions about the consequences of scientific progress and serves as a reminder of the ethical dilemmas that accompany it. A must-watch for those intrigued by science, history, and the human experience."
"This has to be experienced in a cinema with high quality sound system. The sound plays a crucial role in the experience of watching this non-stop high paced movie. The movie is 3 hours long but did not feel like it, in fact I was surprised when it finished. It is a classic hit and keeps you on the edge of your sit. I would give the movie itself 9/10 but because of the amazing visuals plus sound editing, the cinematic experience elevates it so gets a rare 10/10 for me. The acting is superb. Murphy and RDJ give monstrous performances. If indeed Nolan is planning on making biographies, I am really looking forward to watching them because this was the best Nolan movie so far, well The dark knight has a special place in my heart but this was an intense experience for sure."
As a fan of both Cillian and Nolan sir ..this films brings the joy of watching a super grand historic saga in the cinema halls ... Oppenheimer has made me travel 250 kms for IMAX ...as i know if i miss this i will not be able to forgive myself .. This film not only makes u at the edge of the seat knowing all the outcomes but also makes ur ears focussed on the exceptional dialogues and bg score . Not forgetting the performance given by RDJ ..he has given one of the best performances in his career ...This film is not only a treat to watch but also shows how The Great Robert Oppenheimer was cheated by his own countrie's pitty politics .. People are saying this is a long movie but watching it never made me feel about the duration of this masterpiece.... and is one of the best casting made for each and every role ...I am sure about watching it again 😍
"Well paced and deftly edited, ""Oppenheimer"" is a suspenseful drama on the legendary physicist's creation of the atom bomb and its world-shattering implications. Cillian Murphy portrays a wide-eyed eccentric Oppenheimer who juggles the challenges of his personal and professional life where his political affiliations clash with the patriotic nature of his work leading to his later troubles with the law. An all star cast including Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek round up an impressive work. With its unflinching look at war, politics and arms ""Oppenheimer"" raises the issues on the thin line between pragmatism and morality. One of the best films of the year, this is a must see."
"Just Brilliant, so intense from start to finish so much so you don't even realise you've been sitting for 3 hrs it's does not feel like that at allThe only slight issue I had was the trinity test explosion scene it was all leading up to that and I feel like I was underwhelmed I know he doesn't like using cgi but I feel like the silence then the effects didn't represent what I thought a atomic bomb would be like and didn't go on very long either, perhaps cgi would have been helpful to truely blow us away as I knew this scene had to illustrate what has now changed for all of us and the dramatic consequences of pressing the button and using oneOther than that utterly brilliant, highly recommended!"
"Too many characters, facts and layers of stories that you develop anxieties watching as to be hopeful not to missed any details so that might make the whole movie incomprehensible. Great cast, not so interesting cinematic experience totally not worth IMAX tickets.I think Nolan should focus on sci fi movies and things that he can do as he pleased and not bounded by facts. Its a real pleasure to watch interstellar and inceptions that I have certain expectations on his movies but Oppenheimer and Dunkirk proved that he might not be up to a legendary director level for biographical movies and fact / history."
"Oppenheimer is 80% of interrogation between opphenhimer and Lewis Strauss assembled people to check opphenhimer loyalty to America. It's 10% of Trinity test and 10% some glims of Manhattan project. So it's a crap out of it. Don't watch it in theater , wait and watch in ott. Oppenheimer is much hyped crap. Even though the subject in public domain Nolan not delevared a good script. It's another fail movie from him.It's 3 hour move. Only half an hour can watch. I m fully West desspointed after watching it. It's waste of 100 million dollars cost. He did crap this time. Nolan will remember this failure."
"(9.7) A near perfect film and easily one of the best films I've ever seen. The cast is amazing and each actor performs like they never have before, particularly Murphy and Downey. The tone of the film transforms with the plot throughtout and the movie is plauged with themes of guilt that are expertly shown through Nolan's Directing and Cillian's acting. Towards the second half of the film the directing almost has a kind of aspect of horror. The film might be 3 hours but it does not drag at all and it leaves you wanting more by the end. The best scene is the scene containing the detonation of the atomic bomb."
"Mr Nolan at his best. Just WoW.Performance of Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey JR is just outstanding.The conflict of Oppenheimer's Life as shown is completely apt for such an important person, May be the most important person of that time...
The visuals of TRINITY TEST just blown me away... the work of NOLAN there just shows why as a director he'll be remembered for all along the time...
Overall a masterpiece.. completely satisfied ..
The dialogue ' I AM BECOME THE DEATH, THE DESTROYER OF THE WORLD ' just shows the POV of Oppenheimer himself... What he thought about it was clearly shown in the film.. loved it completely...."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a magnum opus that showcases Christopher Nolan's brilliance as a filmmaker. Spanning four decades of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, the film masterfully weaves a scrambled chronology, captivating audiences with its absorbing narrative. Cillian Murphy delivers a mesmerizing performance, embodying Oppenheimer's complex and enigmatic persona. Nolan's monumentalist approach immerses us in the grandeur of the story, exploring the moral implications of Oppenheimer's work and the era's social complexities. The movie's visuals are a symphony of artistry, magnificently capturing the essence of the Los Alamos years and Strauss' sequences. With a stellar supporting cast, ""Oppenheimer"" ignites essential discussions that remain relevant today. Nolan's cinematic brilliance elevates ""Oppenheimer"" to a profound and timeless work of art, leaving a lasting impact on its audiences."
"Christopher Nolan has delivered yet another cinematic masterpiece with this dark, poignant and powerful biopic of deeply flawed yet brilliant mind. Using Kai Bird's book ""American Prometheus"" as a platform, Nolan leaves the audience contemplating Robert's motivation as an American icon or Anti hero.As J. Robert Oppenheimer and his contemporaries are questioned in relation to his loyalty to his country and Soviet communist ties, we are transported to the turmoil of the professional and private life of Oppenheimer and the mind that would change the world.There are standout performances everywhere, most notably Robert Downey Jnr and of course Cillian Murphy, who could be knocking the door on an oscar nod. Using no CGI also adds to the films authenticity. This is just one of those cinematic moments despite it's length, is simply brilliant."
"This film is pure cinema. Its the perfect combination of brillant story telling and outstanding performances. Its not just about the making of bomb. Its more about the politics that played around it. Some of the shots are so brilliant that you feel like you are actually in the film and it feels like it should never end. Looking at the reviews from everyother platform, you might as well know about the performance of Cillian Murphy. No doubt its one of the best character display I have ever seen, but for me the impact which Robert Downey Junior makes, is worth a special mention. Overall the movie is a great experience and if you wish to watch it, watch it only in IMAX. You will not regret it."
"Just walking out of the theatre after watching the double feature #Barbenheimer. The two-hour movie was awful. AWFUL! I'm so glad I got to see that one first because the three-hour movie...aka Oppenheimer...was genius. Absolutely phenomenal. I will have to see it again to clear up in my mind which guys was which scientist. Einstein (obvious, of course) was a glorious character (as he was in real life), so I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Conti's portrayal of him. I am a huge fan of Matthew Modine - what a gift to see him on the big screen again. Gary Oldman is unreal (and unrecognizable) as Truman. Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Downey's (Strauss') advisor (don't know who the actor is) steal the last 25 minutes of the show. Wonderful work all around!"
"This movie is the most intense movie i have seen in a theatre. The whole 3 hours felt so intense. Even the interrogation scenes were near perfect dialogues. I didn't felt a single scene was forced or amateurish. Coming to acting, Cilian Murphy delivers his career best performance, and Matt Damon was extraordinary and Robert Downey might have given his best acting till date. Even without a single fight scenes, Nolan has made this more interesting than most of superhero movies. I think the dialogues deserve extra credit. Reminds me of watching 'The godfather' movie which had perfect dialogues. Definitely this one tops Dunkirk and Tenet, but I can't really compare this with Interstellar, prestige and inception, because of difference in genre.The best movie in last few years!Cinematography-10/10
Background score-10/10
Acting-9.8/10
Length-8/10."
"This movie has too much going on and not enough at the same time. The focus seems to be communism and a senate confirmation hearing rather than the reasoning and human impact of the bomb. The war is always far off and distant, the impact on Japan only briefly mentioned, and the real person we are to have sympathy on is the title character. Even the building of the bomb lacked the challenge and exploration that it could have. It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter and even shorter focused less on the communism angle. While it hinted at why the bomb may have not needed to be dropped, since the viewer is left with no understanding of the state of the war with Japan it feels like more of an intellectual discussion than an in the moment approach to bringing the world's worst war to a close."
"I still vividly remember watching ""Interstellar"" for the first time when I was 10 years old. I was captivated, not necessarily by the story - which I didn't fully understand at the time - but by the manner in which it was portrayed, and by the depth of emotion conveyed by the actors. My experience with ""Oppenheimer"" was similar. Although the movie initially captivated me, I found myself lost for about ten minutes due to my difficulties with English as a second language. However, the remainder of the film had me utterly mesmerized. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot; Nolan never disappoints."
"Man I can't describe how I feel , I feel amazed, I feel sad , I feel emotional. I really wish to watch that movie again if could, like who wouldn't like that peace of masterpiece, Christopher Nolan never let you down when he directs a movie.that Man will be the best director to ever come in history. I can't believe what he did honestly. The film is perfect in many ways
The music in the background, the graphics, the acting prefromance from the actors , the filming. I'll be so sad if they didn't at least win 4 Oscars awards I'll be so f#ckin mad , at last I really do recommend to watch the film at least 2 times and yeah that's all."
"I watched this movie both in English and Hindi languages,and no doubt this could become one of the highest grossing R rated movies.Positives of the movie is Christopher Nolan's screenplay,direction, performances of the lead cast and soundtrack. These type of movies would easily become slow paced and dull,what makes this movie interesting is fast paced editing, brilliantly crafted non linear story telling.It's true that this movie is not for everyone, but everyone is on for watching it. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece that blends emotions,drama, suspense and horror. CLIMAX of this movie hits harder than a cricket ball!!!"
"This movie was so interesting and engaging to watch and you don't know how 3 hours went. The story, the depiction of events, the performances by the cast members, the direction, the screenplay, the BGM, the pacing; everything were great. You can't find a single error in this movie except visuals but you don't need those type of visuals in this type of movie. Christopher Nolan did it, he has shown us that he can make any type of movie either it be sci-fiction or historical drama.Overall, I will definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It's so engaging and intense that you will definitely love it."
"What a historical figure to make a biopic of, what a filmmaker who made it, what an actor who portrayed him. When filmmaking is good its power is immeasurable, not even in Gigatons. And this is good cinema, plain and simple. Using the media of audio and visuals to elicit emotion in a meaningful way.I do think it's Chris's greatest work, a culmination of all his experiments, all his hustle and the years he put in to be trusted by those with the money to make what he wants to make. What set this apart for me is his subtlety with it. It feels like he understood there was no need to shout, to make it spectacular and play service to his fans. In doing so he has surely created a style of biopic that is going to be studied for years to come.I loved it, and am glad I got to see it. It's a great piece of work by great artists, whenever that can happen in the world it should be celebrated."
"This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.I truly do not understand the hype - I have loved ALL of Nolan's previous works but he's stepped far away from his comfort zone in this feature. It's a style of movie that I would enjoy if I was heading in knowing it was written by Aaron Sorkin - a movie of this pace requires such a talent in order to survive. However, as Nolan is not Sorkin, the script and pace are equally interminable to the point where I had to walk out after 2 hours just to save time in my life.Honestly by the time I left, I didn't even know what was happening in the story or, quite frankly, why Nolan thought it would be interesting enough to tell - I can now understand why this story hasn't been told before."
Saw it in imax. I should admit that this is the best cinema experience I have in recent times. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is phenomenal. The screenplay is way ahead of what we predict but is not confusing. There are few scenes which are glued to my mind and are unforgettable. Every actor and actress have given their best. RDJ was so good as Strauss. This movie is definitely for the Physics freaks our there every scene is properly accurate to the theories and laws of the subject. The only issue is the length where I felt that easily at least 10 - 15 minutes could have been easily cut as they were kind of unnecessary to the film.Overall a phenomenal experience in the cinemas. Do watch it only in cinemas with the best sound quality and biggest screen(imax recommended) possible.
"I Had The Best Cinematic Experience Of My Life And Credit Goes To The Genius Christopher Nolan, As A Long Time Nolan Admirer I Had Huge Expectations Going In, But The Movie Exceeds My Expectations On Every Level. From The Very Start The Movie Grabs Your Attention and Never Lets It Go Till The Credits Roll. The Movie Is Lives And Dies On The Performance Of Cillian Murphy and He Carried The Audience Throughout The Movie, Murphy Nailed The Role Of The Complex Scientist In Every Possible Way. Every Cast Member Gave The Best Performance Of Their Career. The Soul Of The Movie Is It's Background Score. The soundtrack keeps you on the edge of your seats every moment no matter what's happening in the scene. The soundtrack speaks it's own language. At Last But Not Least This Movie would not be possible without the mind of Christopher Nolan."
"So much to learn about the science of the creation of those bombs! We have an amazing cast, doing things we need to learn about, so we can fully think them through. An eerie scene of the testing of the bomb shook through the whole room, but other than that, it did not live up to the hype that it should be seen on the big screen. Emily Blunt's character was nice to watch as the wife who had to part ways with her self to let the man do his work while she just sat around. On the other hand, there was one woman on the scientists team. Robert Downey Jr. Stole the show, as did Matt Damon.From Figs."
"This movie can be easily called a masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Though this is a well-known and well-documented story, I think the way it was presented by the director is jaw-dropping. Never in the entire running time of this movie, I felt bored. All the characters essayed the roles in a beautiful way too. Cillian Murphy looked and acted really like Dr. Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr.'s role as Lewis Strauss is a class apart too. From the promotions of this film, I thought Robert Downey Jr. Would play a side role, but his role was almost as important as the lead character in this movie. Nolan's play with the black-and-white scenes and their interplay with the chromatic scenes seem like a genius move. I would suggest people to watch it in IMAX, if possible."
"An intriguing character, an historic time, a chance to show what made the man whose name the film bears, squandered on an overbearing visual and audio production. Loud, building, ever-present music, probably to make up for the lack of dramatic dialogue in the script. No family back-story, none of the quirks of his character as a young man, just a series of short episodes in labs while music plays incessantly and too loudly. Jumping back and forth in time, to create a sense of mystery to demonstrate a great man taken down by pettiness. You can't make this movie without hitting some high notes and the test scene brilliant, and the sense of moral regret is well delivered. But the overall production, especially the editing, and the focus on the 'trial' and the decision to omit the early back-story years, creates a gap that is never quite filled, despite the brilliance of Cillian Murphy portraying a man struggling with the impact of what he has unleashed on the world, not to mention a host of fabulous cameos."
This movie is arguably the Nolan film with more conversations than visual treatment. The movie is non-linear with a court room kind of trial at the main proceedings. Robert Downey Jr and Cilian Murphy are just too good for the roles.At some point you wonder where is this heading with too much conversations. The movie weighs heavily on the convoluted character of Oppenheimer played by Murphy. This is one of the truest biopic that does not glorify / villify the protagonist. It stays as close as to an enigmatic theoretical scientist and his world of science and morality.The last act is good!!
"Definitely an Oscar winning movie, Nolan as usual challenging himself beyond the limit of CGI and creating amazing locations. All actors did tremendous performances especially Cillian. Cillian perseverance in every character & role makes him really deserving of winning an Oscar. It's not a typical biography movie you'd expect but it's full of science and physics which Nolan clearly loves. And then comes the movie score it was on point in every scene escalating to the movie theme music. Knowing that it's a 3h movie it's not easy to keep you involved in the movie the whole time but Nolan did & and he did it brilliantly."
"For films like Oppenheimer, we fell in love with cinema, in short (Oppenheimer), which is the perfect meaning of the perfect, flawless, distinguished film, which Nola succeeded in presenting an exceptional biographical film. This movie is the greatest cinematic experience I've ever had. Nolan presented a historical and innovative masterpiece in terms of storytelling and ambiguity in a well-known true story. He presented the dialogues in an interesting and enthusiastic manner. The soundtrack was used in the film with the events in a great way. The sound effects are the best ever. As well as visual. Great acting performance by Murphy, Junior and the rest of the film's cast. The film has many of famous actors who were not disclosed in the film's trailer . Don't miss this movie. Thank you, Nolan and the rest of the crew."
"I was afraid that 3h would be too long, I was wrong. The movie captured my attention from beginning to the end. The whole film making turned the experience involving and epic.There are a lot of ""easter eggs"" for those interested in history of science. One of my favorites was the bongo from Feynman (those that appear on his Lectures on Physics...).They don't use the screen time to teach physics (and I think this was a good decision) although a few small concepts are explained.Not everything was perfect, the impactful phrase ""Now I've become death..."" was said without no impact in the movie. Anyway, I left the cinema with the feeling of ""wow, marvelous""."
"Oppenheimer was everything I wanted it to be and more. The three-hour run time is very warranted. Not only does it, not waste time. It shows you the realistic experiences of what the makers of the bomb and, most importantly, J Robert Oppenheimer went through making this. You don't have to like this movie if it's not your cup of tea, but if you say it is terrible, you are either straight-up stupid or insane. This is easily one of the best films of the year. If not the best, we will soon see, but I doubt it. This might not be my favorite Nolan film, but it might be his best and most Oscar-worthy. With a $100 million budget, this puts Disney to shame with all these effects being practical and something like Dial of Destiny being a lot of CGI. Please see the film, and you won't regret it."
"The combination of Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy and Ludwig Gorranson without any doubt leads to the very best, which it did. Amazing, excellent, best qualities if every element in cinema. A movie made by a genius. The music is so good, other gorransin's works i had heard were book of boba fett and mandalorian, unique . This one also is really excellent. It was great seeing cillian on big screen after peaky blinders. As usual, at his best. Mat damon and robert downey were amazing. Emily blunt. They really worked as a team and created this memory long lasting movie . Bravo, i really enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone."
"After making a semi pilgrimage to watch this film in one of the handful of IMAX theaters in California, my main takeaway is frustration. Way too much of the dialogue is drowned out by background noise. Struggling to make sense of what characters are saying is not my idea of a good time. The director appears to have fallen in love with this technique. While he and ""critics"" verbally put an artistic spin on it, I truly believe there's nothing more to it than a deep seated power complex. It really knocked the enjoyment down several pegs for me. So much going for this film and yet my lasting takeaway is annoyance."
"This movie was a great one directed by someone who in my opinion is one of the best directors of our time. The story was very well timed and payed out with the development of all of the characters and their relationships with each other.Before this movie I did not know anything about the man who the movie is named after but, now after seeing it I am drawn to conduct some research on him and his work from that time period. Chris Nolan's does an incredible job unrolling and unfolding the plot and twists without allowing his audience to know or expect what's coming next. In my opinion this film may be up for and win the title of Best picture this year at the Oscars."
"In my opinion, Oppenheimer is most likely the best movie we will watch in this decade. Everything about it is so beautifully handcrafted. To think this movie uses 0 cgi is mind blowing to me. The story is not boring at all; for three hours my eyes were stuck to the screen and not for a single moment I was tired or checked my phone. Oh yes, of course, if possible watch it on the biggest screen possible. But just please go watch the movie you will not be disappointed!Ludwig Göransson went above and beyond with the score. My chest and my soul were shaking and felt satisfied after feeling such beautiful score. Chris Nolan has outdone himself!"
"The second best movie from christopher nolan, but if you an action boy please dont watch it this movie is a masterpiece and it dosent contain the action you want. Cillian Murphy that's one of the best performance i've ever seen and everyone watched the film will confirm this .I want to praise the sound effects of the movie, they are from another world and make you fit into the movie in an indescribable way.And I strongly recommend that you watch the movie on an imax screen. I know that you will say that it is not worth it, but after you watch the movie, you will thank meIn the end this movie is the best biographical film of all time."
"Two things got me into the theater. They were the interesting subject and curiosity about how such a story would be told. Plus the fear that this fun theatrical experience might tank before I got around to it. No worry, there. This is the stuff of legend, as it should be. This thought provoking movie tells us exactly why that is so. If you don't know anything about what happened prepare to be amazed. It is based on a book and reading history might also be something you would enjoy. I was a little surprised at the style. A little chaotic and loud. It all comes together, though. One character, an ordinary (seriously smart) man called by unusual circumstances to participate in one of the greatest events in contemporary history. It also tells why anyone would ever do such a thing, for it is quite awful in every sense. Anyway, if you can get past the effort to get us into Oppenheimer's head using weird graphics and strange musical effects, the somewhat altered depiction of real events in the interest of storytelling, and the three hour run time, you may find yourself rewarded with a first class entertainment."
"If you have even a passive interest in the subject or the politics behind the topic, uts a good movie. Casual viewers may get lost.The story was chaotic with many characters to follow. And tge editing style.made it difficult at times to follow. Alot of jumping around.And the score overshadowed the dialog at times. So loud it seemed out of place.It's kind of like Dunkirk. Very underwhelmed considering the hype. For instance, the size and scope of the Los Alamos town wasn't portrayed very well, kind of like how the size and scope.of Dunkirk evacuation fell flat.Good not but not great. Enjoyed it but wouldn't see it again."
"I'm glad i saw another Nolan film in the theatre. The amazing soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, outstanding performances... it's a masterpiece that tells the story of a necessary evilonce again, Cillian reminds us that he's one of the goats. Matt Damon is exceptional; the fleeting appearances of Gary Oldman and Casey Affleck don't leave anyone indifferent, and RDJ... in those last twenty minutes he shows that this is the best acting he has ever done in his lifethe Trinity test is one of the best sequences i've ever seen in a movie. Nolan is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of the modern cinema."
"I don't know how to put it into words but Nolan just delivered a
MONUMENTAL MASTERPIECE.Movie is not about the attacks on Hiroshima-Nagasaki, or the Bomb, it is all about the Character of Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer played by another genius Cillian Murphy. Oh man what dephths, Christopher brings into his characters, its extraordinary!""Amateurs chase the sun and get burned. Power stays in the Shadow!""- Robert Junior is killing it!!Being an oscar worthy film and with the whole cast, is fine and all, but this one is by far the most well written, flawless, or say its simply Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus!"
"I watched this film in IMAX last night and it was amazing and the ending will shock you. I thought the sound design and cinematography was superb but the acting was even better. Cillian Murphy had a phenomenal performance and Robert Downy Jr. Was very good and stuck to his role. I have seen every single Nolan film, but they way he sees his films layered out is far different then other filmmakers of this generation. Oppenheimer is a brilliant piece of cinema directed by brilliant Christopher Nolan about a brilliant man named Oppenheimer. Yet the realization of the creation of this bomb made me feel scared. Oppenheimer will now not only be known as the man who created the atomic bomb, but the one who is will end the world as we know it. True masterpiece."
"Oppenheimer is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, based on the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. It stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, and explores his personal and professional life, his moral dilemmas, and his legacy.Oppenheimer is a fascinating and impressive film with an incredibly visceral pacing to it. It is a testament to Nolan's vision and craftsmanship, as well as Murphy's acting prowess. The direction, editing, sound, cinematography... everything in this is just top tier. It is a film that is certainly worth watching for its cinematic achievements and its exploration of the human condition in the face of scientific discovery and moral dilemma."
"Another masterpiece created by the genius Nolan. Everything in this movie is top notch: The acting performances, the directing, the writing, the editing, the sound, the production, the cinematography, the score, even the make up and costume design.Nolan should get an oscar nommination for best director. Cillian Murphy should get an oscar nommination for best actor just for his eyes expression only :). Too many great supporting actors/actresses that should get oscar nommination too (RDJ, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke, even Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck).This is a work of art in a movie format."
"By far Christopher Nolan's best written movie to date! Oh man just the dialogue alone gets you going. You add in these new crispy black and white IMAX scenes. Such a fun movie with so much anticipation. The characters are all so layered and all the actors do a fantastic job (kudos to casting.) Fastest 3 hours for a movie experience I'm still waiting for Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon, but this is the front runner for best picture. I have so much respect for Christopher Nolan not just as one of the best film makers of all time, but just being loyal. I would be shocked if Cullen Murphy does not win the Oscar this year. Still a few more movies to come out but this was a damn good movie! Great time for cinema! At least 4 great movies in theaters right now. Please go out and support!"
"I'm not gonna lie and say I was 100% excited for Oppenheimer because I wasn't at first, I remember seeing the trailer in the cinema and thinking ""yeah I'm gonna watch that one day"" anyway the whole Barbenheimer thing happened and my hype grew for the film (more for Barbie if I'm being honest) but I just left the cinema and wow.It is a masterpiece, it's so well crafted that it didn't even feel as though I was sat there for three hours, I watched it in IMAX and I feel as though you need to in order to fully appreciate Oppenheimer. The sound is mixed so we'll (which is usually the opposite when it comes to a Nolan film) and the performances of every character is marvellous."
"I watched it on imax and This is one if not the best theatre experience that I've ever scene
and i think at least you should watch it on a really biggest screen as possible because believe me this is a truly another experience that may have not seen before
nolan storytelling on it's peak but I understand that this film may be not everyone cup of tea
So don't be fool by any review you see
You must watch it and make your own thoughts about it.Nolan gives us a biographical film but by his own way
The film is such a horror and horrible in a good way , the impact that leaved me after watching it. Just a SHOCK
It's not just a great movie it's really beyond that
One of the most important film in this century . We are experiencing the consequences , fears, and dilemmas of the events narrated in the story so far."
"I understand that many people were disappointed by the film because they were waiting a movie about the ww2 or the making of the atomic bomb, from the name of the movie you knows that its not, it about the story of oppenheimer. A little boring and a little too long and some time make so confused by the many names and informations that were thrown in some scenes, but it's intentional by nolan, he wants you to stay focus and enjoy the dialogue which you should if you are a true cinema lover. A masterpiece in every single way from music to cinematography to story telling....
Not the best film in the history that's for sure but it is indeed the most important story in the history of mankind."
"This movie is a treat to eyes. Visuals are spectacular. Cinematography is top notch.This movie teaches us a lot about Atom Bomb and how it was made.The story is beautifully crafted. Nolan did a perfect job in writing. Sound work in this movie is probably the greatest part. We can literally feel in the theatre what is happening in the movie. For first time the story can be a bit confusing. But with more watching the story gets more clear (Classic Nolan Things 🙂)
Cillian Murphy, RDJ,Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Demon, Rami Malek & many others did the perfect job. From all of them I think the character of RDJ is the most unpredictable one (There is a surprise, not giving any spoiler though)Go, watch this movie and experience this beautiful piece of history."
"I walked into this movie with the expectation of it being anywhere from a top 5 Chris Nolan film to a Top 5 film of all time. Seeing it in IMAX, witnessing, feeling and experiencing the film in full force. I can honestly say it's closer to the ladder than the former for me. Am I saying it's 100% a top 5 film of all time? No necessarily but I think it's of the cloth of all those films like the Godfather, 2001, Shawshank ect. I think this is the best Nolan film, I think he truly made his magnum opus here and I can't wait to see if and or when he trys to top this. This is also probably the best true story I've ever seen adapted. Cillian was oscar worthy and should receive best actor for how his eyes carried so much weight in this film. Watch this film and my review on deep thought productions on YouTube. Thanks."
"Finally, another Christopher Nolan film. I always look forward to going to the cinema and once again he didn't disappoint. After Tenet, which I thought was really hard to understand, this was a treat. Well made with good moments and made even better by the fact that it is history. I was sucked in right from the start as the various cuts that followed were nice and overall it grabbed me right from the start. I enjoyed every moment and waited until the explosion of course. That's what interested me the most. Again, I wasn't disappointed, but what mainly improved it was the audio. I was expecting a nice spectacle. I got that. I had pretty high expectations there, so it didn't wow me that much, but it appealed to me very positively with Ludwig Göransson's music, which always drew me into the story. At one point, he had me pretty well riveted with his music as well. I was a little worried about how it would turn out without Hans Zimmer, but it turned out that it wasn't only Tenet who had such a great soundtrack, at least in my opinion. I liked the music."
"Oppenheimer was a fantastic excellent and visually compelling piece of cinematic art; I saw it in IMAX. It was awe-inspiring in that format was very visual, loud, and realistic. It was really loud and really visually stunning I had to sight in the front row where it felt like you were really getting hit by an atomic It was great but I would recommend sitting in a middle row. The film overall had excellent performances from its cast, especially Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr all of them were fantastic, and the IMAX experience really heightened it since it was how the film was intended to be seen instead a lower quality digital version."
"Never seen so many people sitting so quietly in a movie threater. 3 hours of pure connection with the film is guaranteed. The music is fab. The dialogues are amazing with the facts, science, politics at a particular timeline is thoroughly covered. It has everything one can ask from a movie. The actors are amazing, seeing so many familiar faces, Hugie from The Bois series, the boy from the film Heridertary. The kid from the Assassination of Jesse James the scientist Papa from stranger things, Matt Damon, Iron man himself and Mr Robot Rami Malik and Emily Blunt. So many familiar faces such great team. The actors gave their all. Going to watch it again in IMax after refreshing the famous political terms."
"The movie is awesomI advise anyone to see a movie whose story is universal and sweet. Cillian Murphy excelled in the character of Robert Oppenheimer And I will go to watch it on the 21st in Iraqi cinemas. The movie is awesome and very strong. I recommend it. The strength of the movie gives you an experience of art and hardshipI don't know why this legendary work is being compared to the failed Barbie movie Opheimer will win an Oscar, an integrated film in all respects, a historical and biographical film I advise you to watch it in IMAX cinemas Don't forget to add me on Instagram, my name a.dq4."
"Saw the movie "" OPPENHEIMER "" at PVR Phoenix( Parel) on the first day second show of its release in India on Friday(22/7/2023). As a student of history found the movie true to its era of "" World War II "" but was also surprized regarding the bold sex scenes in the film. Definitely a bit censured to Indian audiences. The film was extraordinary in special effects while depicting the testing of the first atomic bomb and subtle in not showing the dropping of the 2 atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Having visited Zurich was amazed to see the Grossmünster church towers depicted in the initial introduction of the film. Excellent movie but could be boring for non history buffs. A Oscar contender and if a film addict don't miss this film even if physics is not your pet subject of discussion."
"I watch most Christopher Nolan movies as they are long and in depth as he is a director that tries to state his case. His latest ""Oppenheimer"" is a well done look at a complex and important historical figure in scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer the developer who created and discovered the atomic bomb. The film is informative and it takes the viewer thru different time periods, while blending the life of a man with the current world. The cast and acting is all star form with Murphy who's great as Oppenheimer the chemistry is supported just fine by Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Florence Pugh. Along the way the scenes are tense as one can see that Oppenheimer has some regret and remorse after he created the bomb. It really takes one back to the days of the Cold War, communism, Hitler, and when Russia and Japan weren't friends of America. Over all any historical buff will enjoy this film as it leaves an impact just like Oppenheimer left impact."
"Everything Nolan said about this movie almost does not match its truth, talking about IMAX technology, and the scene of the explosion that the audience will shudder at as if it were real, and about the scenes included in the trailer, all of which gives a very different impression of the movie ..! The huge publicity of the film made the audience (including myself) raise their expectations, and even get ready to watch a movie different from the one they saw in the movie theatre .. Yes, the movie is good, the performance of all the actors is excellent, Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy did amazing performance .. But this is not what they sold us in the trailer and the advertisements of the movie that almost tell about another movie completely .."
"The only thing keeping this movie from a perfect 10 for me is just personal taste. I'll always prefer a Nolan original story than an adapted true story. With that being said, Nolan made this movie as engaging and thrilling as any biographical movie could possibly be. Every element of this film is just top notch filmmaking. I can't really imagine any other movie releasing this year coming close to it, and I expect it to near sweep come award season.Even if you have no interest in this story and find a movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer to be boring, you'll still leave this movie feeling you just witnessed a creator at the top of his game. Not to mention, the gut punch the movie makes with its commentary on the past, present, and future of what nuclear technology is to the world we live in."
"This is a super intense, history-driven movie. It's a linear storyline which is good for a Nolan movie. The performances are phenomenal. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Will certainly get the Oscar awards. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett are all excellent as well. It kept my interest throughout the 3-hour run time and I learned so much about science and history that I did not know before. The storyline explaining how communism, science, and politics were so intertwined and were informing important decisions during the war, was super interesting. I highly recommend this film."
"A feature documentary exploring how one man's brilliance, hubris and relentless drive changed the nature of war forever, led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and unleashed mass hysteria, and how, subsequently, the same man's attempts to co.

"10/10. Gripping, suspenseful and surprisingly intimate. Great casting, even better performances, superb dialogue, and fantastic story telling. Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey, and even Gary Oldman (as short as his time was in the film) deserve Oscar nominations at the very least. Emily blunt was also amazing. This is Nolan's best work and it's not even close. Every scene had meaning, no useless scenes or useless dialogue. A lot of people seem to forget it's not just about the Manhattan project, it's about OPPENHEIMER.Most of the bad reviews are from people who think the dark knight trilogy is Nolan's best work."
"Jaw dropping intensity and allure. A sequence filled with enigma. Sequences carefully curated in the highest quality. Filled with scenes and cinematic with the most delicate care, intrusive details, emotional intensity delivered in the most impactful way. Knowing little about the figure that is J. Robert Oppenheimer, or knowing far too much, this doesn't miss a dot. From perfect edge-of-seat timing, to precision of words and delivery by a profound set, this is an absolute homage to the complexity that makes this physicist and relative figures. Hero or villain, martyr or heathen, is beside every point, as this film goes to challenge every point of view and leaves a pondering, critical, thought provoking moment that in of itself leaves a most bittersweet feeeling."
"This film is magnificent. In the hands of a lesser director I think this would have been average and a bit of a snorefest -potentially. Nolan never lets this happen with astounding score, crackling dialogue , flawless acting and the typical Nolan direction. There is never a dull moment. Also there's a real element of suspense/ tension that Nolan exudes which makes this biopic feel more like a suspenseful drama but never swaying away from documenting the self titled life story. If the film had ended at the bombing I think I would have given this one less star but the last 40 minutes post bombing is riveting cinema and elevates it to almost greatness. Is this Nolan's best film? Not for me but is never the less a fantastic achievement."
"Do not waste your time, it's like skurls have put a face of Nolan, and made a film !!! There is no other explanation that he needed so much publicity than a unique storytelling, as he often does.Same as Wes Anderson lost it with ""The French Dispatch"" last year and now the ""Asteroid City"" Nolan has lost it too !! There is no creativity, the touch of Nolan I expected !!I know some people hate ""Tenet"" but I am amazed with the concept and how they make it possible, but this film, which he's been calling his dream project, is a disaster !!He's good with conceptual storytelling, otherwise we have the same film in bollywood - Rocketry: The Nambi Effect and two seasons of Rocket Boys !!"
"An absolutely stunning achievement in cinema. Nolan rarely disappoints and this is one of his finest. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of brilliant, along with the supporting cast. The sheer horror of what they created in that desert and its impact on history is conveyed with tension and measure. This is a three hour film and it feels shorter. There wasn't a moment where I was bored or felt it was dragging on. Nolan is a master or practical effects over CGI and the trinity test scene was executed so well. Along with the Los Alamos victory speech. Stunning. Overall I give this exquisite film 10\10 and highly recommend!!!"
"""Oppenheimer"" is a three hour, dialog- driven narrative that's nearly the life story of the man chiefly responsible for inventing the atomic bomb. The movie gives Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. The roles of their careers, as they become dueling scientists over the years. Emily Blunt brings a stark intensity to the role of Oppenheimer's wife. There's a twenty minute sequence just before and after the test explosion in the desert that displays the anticipated visual thrills, but viewers looking for mind-blowing effects throughout will be disappointed. Audiences looking for a rather sophisticated depiction of a troubled period in global history, however, might enjoy this. Gary Oldman is on screen for no more than 90 seconds near the end, but he gives a devastating portrayal of President Truman, who meets with Oppenheimer briefly, weeks after the end of the war. The movie not once falls into the trap of trivializing the subject by being a roller coaster ride of special effects, and for that reason alone, Nolan should be congratulated."
"Best line of the movie by Gary Oldman in a cameo that lasted less than two minutes. While Oppenheimer advertises on his creation, where it delivers is its exposure and reveal of the upper echelon of war and how something as concrete as us versus them can turn into you versus the world. Having that impending doom loom over his shoulders yet having to stand and listen to escalation at every level of more and more is where this film will make your hair fall out, and not from radiation but that which is much worse, stress. I love this movie and believe Nolan made a traditional documentary story into a riveting revelation about how the world is forever changed. We could all stand to watch this movie with held breath."
"This film is brilliant. The movie is 3 hours long but it felt more like 2 to 2 and a half hours. It can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, and I definitely recommend to do a bit of research of who Robert. J. Oppenheimer was. It's also a film that you need to pay really close attention to, you could easily miss something. The audio is perfect and I didn't have any problems with hearing the voices of the characters, I watched this in IMAX by the way and I definitely recommend the reader to also watch it in this format. You can't expect action from this movie because if you do you will be disappointed, the film contains mostly scenes of the person's talking, but Nolan manages to even let scenes like this feel thrilling. The acting performance is magnificent, probably the best of 2023, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey jr. Were brilliant. The visuals were also very impressive considering the fact that they didn't use any CGI this whole movie. The fact is that this film is objectively good even though I'm not a film expert of any sorts, and I definitely recommend to watch it (In IMAX if possible)."
"Christopher Nolan has returned and how!! Oppenheimer is another one of his beautiful creations. A movie which really is more than a movie. The intensity between the scenes, the slow yet powerful background... The creative mind behind the use of colours, and the impact it created. The movie is not just about a bomb or how is it build.. It's about the process one goes through while trying to make a change for his country. Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer has delivered one of the best performances of his career. But the x-factor comes out as RDJ. The emotions which were needed were perfectly delivered by him. In short, Oppenheimer is not everyone's cup of tea but those who love the reality stricken movie will definitely love it."
"Once and for all.....Oppenheimer was NOT the father of the atomic bomb. The basic premise of chain reaction was Leo Szilard. Einstein did not write a letter to Roosevelt (he only signed it) Leo Szilard did. Fermi was only partly in charge under the bleachers. Leo Szilard saw his prediction completed there. Oppenheimer was a bureaucrat, a manager who was put in to co-ordinate a host of scientist, many of whom were Oppenheimer's better. And I wonder that not one person bothered to remember the first class BBC production made decades ago. If there is a father of this invention it was Szilard who in the end hated it."
"I love movies that take themselves seriously, actually made with the intent of bringing something new or something unique to the world of cinema. This movie is most likely going to be my movie of the year due to Nolan's skill as a top tier director. The way that the film balances the black and white (objective scenes) and coloured (subjective scenes) is masterful and so well done. Even with no prior knowledge about Oppenheimer you will be surprised at how much you can relate to his feelings by the end of the film.Acting - 10/10
Plot - 9/10
Sound - 10/10
Music - 10/10
Visuals - 10/10
Pacing - 8/10
Overall - 10/10Watch this in the theatres it is worth it."
"They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand until they've rewatched it. First watch will take you only so far.A lot to take in and absorb. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr have given their best ever performance. Nolan delivers again with his team in Cinematography, Techniques and sound editing. It would definitely take a second viewing to completely appreciate and or understand every aspects.The experience on first viewing is mostly positive and captivating. But Nolan being Nolan with his non linear storytelling and layered character study; this requires to be seen again at it's own pace to be fully grasped. 8.5/10 on first watch."
"In a steady and focused pace, Nolan tells the tail of the man who gave his country a superweapon and whose reputation was compromised by an envious government official. Politics, science, emotions, even humor build op this epic. As far as I am concerned, already a classic. I wonder how many Oscars this movie is going to collect. Cillian Murphy plays the role of his life. Robert Downey j.r. Must win the Oscar for hus role as Lewis Strauss, what a performance! The always sympathetic Matt Damon plays a very convincing hard boiled army general. And finally, Emily Blunt, IS the convincing wife of Oppenheimer, a person not to meddle with. Masterpiece."
"Films like Oppenheimer are the reason to go to a cinema to enjoy a film to the maximum. Perhaps at the end of the year it will turn out that Oppenheimer will be the best film that 2023 has produced and if not it will definitely end up in the top 3. Do not expect a film with a lot of action, because Oppenheimer has become a biographical film with a lot of dialogues and political issues in it. They are Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. They impress in the film, but the rest of the cast also does an excellent job under the wing of Christopher Nolan. The soundtrack may not be as memorable as Tenet's or let alone Interstellar (of course Interstellar was made by Hans Zimmer), but all the elements are on board and the crackle of the Geiger counter under the music really adds power and gets completely under the skin. If you get the chance to visit the film in IMAX, it is absolutely recommended, but if there is no IMAX theater nearby, the regular silver screen will also suffice. In any case, Oppenheimer is a film that you should not miss in the cinema, because you will spend three hours watching this feat in amazement."
"The acting in Oppenheimer is outstanding, from the top of the cast, through supporting actors, to the nearly and actually uncredited.Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan felt it necessary to remind us that the film is about The Bomb every three minutes. The special effects were very well done, but maybe deserving of its own Oscar (who's going to out-soecial-effect an atomic bomb?)Apparently Nolan didn't trust his cast enough to carry the film, which was a huge error. Nolan's direction of the cast, and their performances would have been enough to win a Best Picture without any more than a single flash of light and a BOOM. Let's just hope the incessant booms and overexposures don't wear out the Oscar committee."
"I am jealous of anyone who got to see this masterpiece on an imax screen. It was simply outstanding, visual and score was phenomenal and the acting was top notch. The attention to detail was THERE, this has to be Nolan's best piece. I was not bored at any point throughout the 3hr film. I personally don't believe this is not my favourite Nolan's film (interstellar is) but this is definitely a close first. Before watching the film I would definitely would recommend to do a little research into Oppenheimers history as a lot of people did not understand the movie. Cillian murphy absolutely should get an Oscar for his performance in Oppenheimer."
"I love this movie so much! Its that feeling you get when you know you are watching greatness on the movie screen. It grips you from the very beginning and doesn't let go. I truly didnt feel like it was 3 hours, I could have watched more. All the actors did a wonderful job, but Cillian Murphy should be nominated for best actor for sure, and Robert Downey Jr for supporting actor. The sound effects are amazing! I truly didn't think it would be that great, I didn't have any expectations, but I'm so glad I went to see it. This movie has to be seen on the big screen so you can feel the sound. I want to thank everyone who made the awesome movie."
"I took a couple of days to digest three hours of slow burn drama so here we are, ready to blast an impossibly objective review. Let's begin with the obvious: this is 100% Nolaned; the script is clean and meticulous; Robert Downey Jr stands out for best acting followed by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt; Matt Demon isn't credible; the music is too insidious; the visuals and the story itself aren't worthy of a big screen. Now that the most evident is dissected, here is the trick. The movie portraits an American patriot that oscillates between pride and guilt with enough elements to pull in both directions simultaneously. And when you think the script was a straight line without twists (and you would be right), subplots emerge to at least complete three hours of dialogues with emoted tension and resolution in the life of a scientist, the father of the atomic bomb, turned both monster and hero. My biggest turn off is that he story and the film deserve two hours - not three."
"One of the few movies that I will suggest someone to watch to fall in love to cinema and movies!Thanks you Nolan for this deep exotic experience that made me check my schedule by the end of the movie to book another ticket in coming days, because watching this art piece once I'm sure is not enough.Thank you great actors and behind the scenes team for the performance, and without all of you, this masterpiece will not be completed.At the end, to make your experience more completed in my point of view is to read about the atomic bomb from scientific side, because this what I felt I'm behind at :))"
"Christopher Nolan breaks out of his bubble of fiction into the openness of realism. Put together: Motivation, lack of motivation, madness, genius, success, fame, conscience, regret, empathy, betrayal and many other scenarios and feelings in a single work bordering on the impossible, which the director should already know. Speaking and explicitly showing the political scenario of the Second World War era on the big screen is not an easy job, which makes it impossible to fully understand what one wants to convey through frames and scenes that are so opaque in sense, when at the same time full. The superficiality of the work has to be noted. A lot of elements were used, as there was no escape, so it makes the pace slower and more angsty, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Some things should have been more detailed, but they weren't. Cinematography? Flawless. Soundtrack? Flawless. Acting? Flawless. 8.5/10."
"I just watched ""Oppenheimer"" and it is a masterpiece. I am not a huge of fan of history nor biography movies, but this movie made me reconsider all my life choices.""Oppenheimer"" started off with a quick pace, which most movies just ignore. The acting performance was on a high level. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Both deserve an academy award. Also, shoutout to the casting team. I did some research and the actors almost identical to whom they portray. And don't get me started on cinematography...
I am a fan of Christopher Nolan and I know how much he can do, but I definitely was not expecting such great job. This is a work of art."
"This movie was an amazing treat. As with all Christopher Nolan movies, the filmography was excellent, audio shook you and really brought up emotions of despair and beauty in certain scenes. I watched this in an IMAX theater so all the sensory effects with amplified. The actors were amazing too.But a word of warning, please go in with the correct expectations. This is a 3 hour long movie that portrays the life of Oppenheimer through the good and bad.The only gripe I had with the movie was that the last hour could have been shortened to about 20 minutes, but that's more of a personal subjective preference.Despite the tiring 3 hour watch, its an overall an outstanding movie and will definitely stand amongst the classics against the test of time."
"I went with my adult kids and we all had the same reaction. The movie was not what we were expecting. The morning of the viewing i was watching the news and they were saying ""the best movie of the year"" and a ""perfect movie"" and ""you must see it in IMAX"".. None of that was close to being true. While an informative movie on Oppenheimer's personal life , not a lot on the inside story of the making of the bomb or the science behind it . Mostly drama about whether or not he had communist affiliations. IMAX was completely useless, there was no great action scenes or great sounds or music. I""m sorry but i don't understand all the 10's, whatever happened to a 10 meaning perfection."
"I believe that we must distinguish the film and the story. The events that inspired this movie are tremendously important and fascinating; but the film itself is a fiasco. First, it is far too long. The first half is a classic portrait of a scientist working on a project. It has nothing outstanding from a cinematic point of view. I had to wait an hour and a half before seeing anything inspired and inspiring. Then, there's the sound: the constant presence of music or sound effects drowns the dialogues and is really, really irritating, while serving a presumably dramatic purpose. The camera work is shallow and uninspired, at best: definitely not what one would expect in a film presented as a great piece of cinema. Fortunately, the actors do a first-class job throughout all this mediocrity.Overall, Oppenheimer fell far below my expectations. This story deserved a much more subtle approach."
"Watch in Imax... you will be blown away.This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time, definitely close to top on my favorites. Cillian Murphy establishes himself as an A-list from this performance alone.Nolan's creative directing style in this movie was unbelievably grasping. How he told this biography makes every single second of this movie exciting. The acting by every single actor helps create this amazing movie. RDJ delivers one of his best performances in years. The cast Nolan got for this movie will have you in disbelief that they are all in this same movie together.This movie deserves every award from directing, acting, sound, effects, etc. 10/10 and no other acceptable answers."
"I'm not the type of guy to leave reviews... it's my first, but I needed to say this, this movie is my best cinema experience to date... it's simply breathtaking, the entire cinema was silenced, all sustaining their breath with the darkness of the movie... the music, the actors, the images it's simply breathtaking. The music was simply superb, it's on loop on my mind. It's a masterpiece that never feels like 3 hours long, leaving the cinema I just thought how I wanted to get back in there and watch it again. I thought the bomb scene would not surprise me and yet it did... and the final was so perfect , just go and watch it and don't loose out on this opportunity."
How in the world this is close to a 9 I don't understand.They need to have a University Class on the subject and characters and the reward of graduating the class with 80% or higher is going to see the movie. What happened to entertainment - my brain was tired in the first hour. First of all - TURN DOWN THE SOUNDTRACK! I would highly recommend that you skip the theatre and wait until it comes out on a device you can get close captioning on as the soundtrack overwhelms all of the dialogue and you can't hear what they are saying which might have helped understand it. I was begging for CC. I think there was one chuckle in the movie - so dark and depressing and muddled. I truly hated this movie even after reading up on the material. Just don't get the high ratings. Maybe people don't want to admit they don't get what is going on? SKIP IT. SERIOUSLY.
"Just returned from the cinema, soaked from the rain, but my mind is still captivated by the masterpiece I just witnessed. Christopher Nolan has once again exceeded all expectations with this film, leaving me in awe during the entire 20-minute walk back home.The combination of an exceptional cast and mesmerizing soundtracks perfectly brought Nolan's vision to life. I can't help but hope that Murphy receives the Oscar he truly deserves for his outstanding performance.Admittedly, if you're not familiar with the historical context of the film's topic, you might feel a bit lost or uninterested. However, I assure you it's still worth watching for its sheer brilliance and cinematic prowess. Nolan has once again proven himself as a master storyteller, making this film an experience not to be missed."
"Movie Oppenheimer by Director Christopher Nolan is excellent. The screenplay, acting, Direction has rekindled interest in Physics and thought process of making of atomic bomb in 1940s. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss did a great job. Matt Damon as Leslie Groves ,an engineer from MIT who went to West Point and as Lieutenant General who oversaw Manhattan project , is excellent. Emily Blunt as bored homemaker and mother of 2 kids is perfect as Oppenheimer's wife. Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's physical weakness is good. The movie is 3 hr long and could be edited without losing content and high quality of ensemble and Direction.My favorite movie of Christopher Nolan is/was Dunkirk and now Oppenheimer ... great movie."
"Well, Oppy is quite an experience. In many ways it's an amazing film, BUT... it's stubbornly nonlinear, as if someone shuffled the storyboards. And somewhat impressionistic. I think Nolan was trying to capture in visuals both the psychological noise of that super-secret project and the zeitgeist of that pressure-packed era - without abandoning the narrative. At 3 hours in length, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea - I realized halfway through I wished we had gone to a theatre with reclining chairs. It really helps if you know the arc of Oppenheimer's story, or at least the moral ambiguity that tempered the scientific deadline to develop a device that ""could"" end life on earth.Caveat: if you're taking your dad, and he just got a pacemaker, bring ear plugs for him. Nolan and his sound designer play audio pranks throughout the film, following a quiet or silent passage with sudden deafening sound."
"As any Nolan films, you'd expect a certain amount of depth from his films, and i think this one tops it. Oppenheimer is anxiety inducing back-and-forth 'court-room' horror-esque , with majestic sound mixing. Whoever in charge of sounds, my guy deserves an OSCAR.I appreciate that Nolan centers the story around Oppenheimer as a person, and not just simply for the 'nuke'. Though, It takes a while to get a good grasp of the plotline, and i can see ways on how the first hour can be shortened as i don't think it's a necessarily needs to be a 3 hour long films.9/10.Cillian, Emily and Roberts are amazing, and also what's with these STACKED casts ??"
"A work of art from this caliber was much needed in this current cinema industry. It shows simple yet incredible filmwork, without unnecessary effects and the story touches the heart and soul - something that many of us in the audeince haven't experienced for years ""thanks"" to Hollywood's recent movies. Above all it makes us think. Think about our personal missions in life, the responsibility for our actions and the injustices of this world. A briliant and chaotic mix of scientific genuis, humblness, lust for power, greed and treachery - all put carefully together in an accurate historical context. In a word - a move away from the cancerous virtue signalling Hollywood and striaght back into the world of classic cinematography by Nolan."
"This film told the incredible story of how some of the worlds most brilliant minds achieved one of histories most momentous tasks. It contained some excellent acting performances and the dialogue was well written. However, there were parts of the story that were overly long and laboured with some of the special effect interventions either unnecessary or too long & dramatic. The single most dissipate annoying feature of the film (a common issue today in film and TV) was the sound. There were barely 10 seconds of silence in the whole 3 hours. The dial was overlayed with 'music' or sounds for almost the whole film, even when just two characters were conversing. There were sections of dialogue in the film which I will never know as they were impossible to discern being drowned out by the accompanying sound. Disappointing."
If you must watch it then wait for streaming at home. Extremely long and boring. One of the worst musical scores in the history of film. The editing was poor. Truly a lame and uninteresting film. Basically as lame as the fact that I have to continue to type words so this review will have enough characters to post. If you must watch it then wait for streaming at home.

"Christopher Nolan does it again, he keeps you focused for 3 hours on the screen wanting to see even more, using a precise script, impeccable photography and a performance by Cillian Murphy that transports you to the very mind of the Head of the Manhattan project, his genius and his romantic and political dramas.His script, the backbone of the film, along with its extraordinary production design, as well as the costume Design , make one feel part of the world of the famous scientist, especially for those of us who were lucky enough to see him in IMAX.This is a MUST see Movie for everyone..."
"My first viewing of this was at a very late night showing at my local IMAX theater and as much as I really enjoyed it, I wish I would have seen it earlier in the day because I felt like I missed certain details while I was already feeling tired. I decided to see it a 2nd time at a different theater not in IMAX and honestly I found the 2nd viewing to be more enjoyable and the film felt like it went faster this time as my mind was more awake and engaged and everything clicked for me. Nonetheless, this is one of the most important films ever made and I really hope it continues to get the praise it deserves."
"It is three hours long, but for a history buff like myself who knows his material, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is absorbing from the start. Most impressive is the star-studded cast who bring the characters to life. Cillian Murphy is perfect in the titular role; Matt Damon is a believable General Groves; Robert Downey, Jr inhabits the part of Lewis Strauss; Tom Conti is transformed into a genial Albert Einstein. The only disappointment is Gary Old man, who had been so excellent as Winston Churchill but here plays Harry Truman like a caricature. Besides the cast, the editing is also amazing. The whole movie plays like a jigsaw puzzle, with different parts being assembled as each piece is put in place at different parts of the puzzle, until the whole picture is finally complete. I find the writing somewhat uneven, however; some parts are brilliant while a few lines come across as corny. Overall, it is a compelling film that is worth savoring more than once."
"Without the doubt, one of the biggest masterpieces of our time. Taking such a sensitive story, and tell it the best way possible. That's signature Christopher Nolan. Needless to say Cillian Murphy was incredibly convincing and accurate. Definitely deserves an Oscar! It is so hard to make a story that is based on historical facts, this interesting. Whole movie keeps you on the edge. Build up is phenomenal, waiting for July 16th 1945 and when it happens, it all make sense. Timeline is not linear and in my opinion this makes the story even more alluring as it leads the audience to think ""why does he feel the way he feels in the future"". Now I've become death, destroyer of worlds!"
"Another banger from the master of practical effect with his usual style of filmmaking that gives a massive middle finger to modern hollywood. Drama all the way to the end, yet the maestro manage to make it far from boring with the intensity and the energy not even today's action movies can compete, not even the fast and the furious latest film can make you sit down watching a three-hour movie makes you not sleepy as if watching a movie with only half the duration. If you think the atomic bomb here is scary, try to see the political intrigue that proceeds AND follows it, the very cost of being the modern version of Prometheus.8.5/10."
I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.
"Same IMDB tripe. Masterpiece. Perfect. Flawless, blah, blah, blah. Its none of that. Its an overly long movie that at times confuses the viewers with flashbacks, BW to Color changes, historical liberties and political correctness. Don't get me wrong, This is the real Hitler and real Nazis and real antisemetism. But the whole latter half of the movie were Oppenheimer is disgraced due to his links to communism is overwrought. Didn't need to know how much of a philanderer he was. Could have fleshed out his relationship with the other scientists. At times too many characters. Good portrayal of Edward Teller.Not a date movie. Any nerd has working knowledge of this man. Nothing new revealed."
"I found the pace of the film was almost like a chain reaction and perhaps that is the intention of the Director. Some brilliant actors, or movie stars, taking relatively small parts. Fitting as the film the science is about stars in the universe. Tom Conti as Einstein was very convincing. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer surely must be nominated for a major award.. Murphy looks just like the Scientist and appears in many scenes of the 3 hour film. The 3 hours passes very quickly as the script doesn't allow one to be distracted or one would literally lose the plot. I got the Science bit but must admit to coming home and googling what was going on politically and who the main players were."
"Focused on the story of Robert Oppenheimer, his struggles and passion for theoretical physics, Christopher Nolan does an excellent job with his ability to portray the possible struggles and barriers a man of his intellect have to overcome.Other than the need to get used to the non-linear method of storytelling Nolan adapts, and the fast cuts between scenes I see no other issues with Oppenheimer.It is clear as day that this movie was not intended for an audience that wants a fun entertainer, rather was intended to an audience that is willing to revisit our history, and learn more about a man that was tasked with a job very few in history have been tasked with.If expectation are set accordingly, this movie can be rather inspiring."
"That is the first time I have legitimately fell asleep in the movie theatre. I am the biggest Nolan fan but I honestly can't see what the appeal of this movie was. It's a painful slog with zero entertainment value, should have just been a documentary. I am not sure who the target audience is for this movie, how is it getting such high ratings?What's more it has somehow the most pointless nudity and jump scared I have perhaps ever seen in a movie, which is so strange because Nolan films in the past distinctly did not rely on such cheap tricks. Seriously why is a film about a physicist chock full of nudity and jump scares? Do people not have a criticial bone in their body anymore? Even Tenant was better than this trash."
"3 hours of breathtaking cinema. Ignore the criticisms around the sound, or the length of the film. This is a masterful cinematic experience. It's packed with stars who all play their part, most of them understated but all helping to move this 'movie of 3 parts' forward.If Cillian Murphy doesn't win the Oscar for this performance then there is truly no justice. His stoic, understated performance is best in class. Amazing.Nolan once again blows me away and I loved it.Lastly, if the central theme doesn't scare the hell out of you then gos help us all!! When the move ended, there was silence in the cinema for 5 minutes. Not a sound. Just contemplation around what was unleashed at Los Alamos."
"Oh man! What to say Oppenheimer is one best history movies I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan pulled it off again. The trademark Christopher Nolan things he did in this film makes this movie so good, mixing the timelines (like in memento), beautiful screenplay, heavy dialogues, fantastic cast, and many more, I can talk about this movie whole day so.... But still people finding it boring I don't know how? Literally my friends were sleeping throughout the film but who cares if you like the movie then who cares right! Ofcourse it has science stuff because we are talking about ""atom bomb"". C'mon man physics chemistry maths is the basic key to becoming a scientist.....
If we talk about cast then I will take any name because everyone did a mind-blowing job....
Anyway if you are a Christopher Nolan fan you will going to love it and if you like slow movies like me then you will definitely going to get fun for what you've paid for...
Parental guidance - It contain nudity so ya you cannot watch it with your family but still pls do watch it......"
"Oppenheimer made the bomb, yet failed to puzzle out power. All happened was a must, one way or the other.It is a brilliant tryout of Nolan. A feast of storytelling, directing, and acting. The film was build upon dialogues and events to reveal the complexity of entanglement among science, people, politics, and power. Together, history was made of a must through everyone holding their grounds and taking sides with or without doubts and questions that no one dare to answer. It is a sincere film load with various flavors to chew on.It does take quite bit of history knowing to better enjoy the movie."
"I dont what to write about this Masterful craft which is so finely done. Every Pixel on the screen served its purpose. Its a biography of one of the most influential physicist of all time. Oppenheimer's character played by Cillian Murphy was just PERFECT. The intensity, complexity and tragedy of the brilliant minds of that time is portrayed like never before.. Also the cast overall is brilliant and unique. World war 2 is the most impactful event of the history of mankind. Personally its very intriguing to me and I love to study the history of our ancestors. The movie portrays the agony and guilt that came afterwards in the life of Oppenheimer. How he was comflicted within himself. How his agony eats him alive and how he was later misunderstood because of his character. I urge people to witness history like never before."
"Movie was released on the 19th in my country. In my opinion, it is the most important film Nolan has ever made. I had goosebumps during THAT part in the middle of the movie and at the end. No viewing experience could have given me that suffocating and colossal feeling than in the cinema. The music score, the cinematography, the acting, everything about it is sublime. I sank in my seat and for a good 5 minutes after it ended, none of the people I watched it with made a move. We just kind of sat there in silence, at a loss for words. See this on the big screens. It's an incredible, haunting piece of art and cinema at its finest.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt are outstanding in this. The cast was just stellar."
"Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves a lasting impact. The direction is top-notch, guiding the audience through a compelling narrative. The performances are outstanding, with each actor delivering their role with confidence - the only exception being Gary Oldman, whose delivery feels a bit weak . The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing every scene with artistic brilliance. The seamless sound-mixing adds depth to the immersive experience. Despite its 3-hour runtime, the plot keeps you engaged - even though it is heavily dialogue based - making time fly by. This film is bound to evoke strong reactions; you'll either fall in love with its brilliance or feel like it falls short . For cinephiles seeking an intellectually stimulating journey, ""Oppenheimer"" is a must-watch."
"My first ever movie review and thank god it's Oppenheimer. Was so invested in it who knew 3 hours had gone by. We talk about Murphy but damn RDJ was exceptional. Well that's on the acting front and Nolan is Nolan, adopted this biopic into it's own style excellently with great character. Each character playing its role brilliantly. And THAT trinity test, wow that was one to watch. You were forced to keep your eye on the screen just so that you might not miss something. Surely will go down as one of the iconic scenes. Now what do I even say about the score every scene had its own mood and complementing each moment exquisitely. Wow. What more can I just say just don't know. This is surely one not to miss."
"Christopher Nolan knocks it out of the park with Oppenheimer. The film is a delight, and is truly meant for the big screen. The ensemble cast assembled for the project deliver the goods.Glad to see Cillian Murphy's loyalty to Nolan, get rewarded with a leading and an impactful role. The cinematography, music were just flawless.While some might feel the film was a tad too long, I disagree with them. 3 hours was totally justifiable for the way the story was paced, and kept me gripped the whole time.The film is the perfect representation of what humans are capable of in our darkest moments."
"What else more is there to say? A great movie. Christopher Nolan has yet done it again as he has done many times. Fantastic actors, you couldn't ask for better performers. The sounds of the movie made it that much better, if you have the chance, listen to it in theaters before it's off the big screen. Timeline was a bit chaotic putting in the present and the future but not overpowering. I was very excited to see the movie when the trailer first got released and I was not let down like many other movies I have seen with hype. 9/10 because even though it was a 3 hour movie, it was very high paced and you wouldn't be able to afford to miss some time. Giving it a 9.5 if it had the option I would. Christopher Nolan does it again."
"I didn't give it 10 stars because it jumps around a lot chronologically, which is a very annoying current trend in film making, and can be confusing even if one's a history buff. Also because in typical Hollywood bleeding-heart-liberal fashion, it talked more about the destruction wrought by the atomic bombs than it did about the hundreds of thousands of civilian Japanese lives that were saved because of the bombs.Other than that, the acting was excellent, which is to be expected from a cast with four Academy Award winners, a two-time Academy Award nominee, and a few BAFTA winners and nominees. The fX were spectacular as well."
The screenplay could have been clearer and less confusing. The story should have been told in a linear chronological manner focusing on the creation of the bomb then the communist witch hunt then exoneration. The focus should been less on the interrogation and Robert Downey's character which keeps interrupting the story. Too many characters are introduced and it's hard to keep track of who is who. Should have left out the mistress and the rather gross love scenes. Rather irritating loud strings soundtrack at crucial moments drowns out the dialogue. Typical Nolan. This is unfortunate because the subject matter is fascinating and it does show how scientists helped win WW2.The message in this movie is quite relevant today warning against military build up and confrontation with Russia. Also about how politicians try to discredit those against their policies.
"Everything in the movie is okay such as acting, set design, makeup, cinematography etc. Except the story line. The film actually consists of two storylines, the first b the process of making the atomic bomb and the second Oppenheimer's loyalty trial. More than that, the film was going in many parallel timelines which was involved in each other and trying to make more complicated but still the film is still smooth and without any peak point. The atomic explosion was not what we expected and there was nothing special about it. Florence Pugh had marvelous acting, but those rate R scenes badly overshadow her acting. And those scenes were unnecessary and not up to Nolan's style."
"Oppenheimer is the greatest cinematic experience I have ever had the chance to immerse myself in. It is an exceptional movie that gave me goosebumps and put me in a solid state of paralysis for 3 hours. Cillian Murphy's acting in this film is (beyond) Oscar-worthy. The visualization of the detonation of the atomic bomb was executed with uttermost brilliance and truly made me feel as if I am about to see with my own eyes, how perhaps one of the most dangerous weapons in the history of humankind is released into the world. Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece and used IMAX technology like no other director has ever before."
"The best among all of Christopher Nolan movies so far. An Historical events told in a most gripping ways, which only he can do. Such an overwhelming cast, worth the story and characters. Cillian Murphy acting as Dr Robert Oppenheimer is beyond words. He is surely getting nominated for Oscars along with Christopher Nolan and others for most of the major categories. Cinematography and sound is another +++.Three phases of story told simultaneously, interwoven so well it will keep you fully engaged. Equally mesmerizing is the interrogation and debates after the Japan bombing. Watch it on iMax screen for maximum fun. Loved it thoroughly."
"Oppenheimer is a masterclass in movie direction but for an average movie aficionado, it's a decent movie with stunning sound design and masterful acting. I am a huge Nolan fan and even with so much hype, he still doesn't disappoint. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is devastatingly magnificent and is extremely well supported by every single one of the cast including good actors playing small cameos. The sound design was one of the best I have heard in recent times. What impressed me the most was the restraint and subtlety exercised while telling this story. In hands of any other director, this could have very easily become a jingoistic and pathos-inducing average movie. So many of Nolan's stories work because of the emotions and bonds behind all the other stuff but i found that part a bit lacking here and that would be my only critique. For me it's a 9.5/10 movie but for a normal movie goer it would be 7.5-8/10 movie."
Yes technically great filmmaking. But sooo boring. Why is the central conflict around the appointment of a potential secretary of commerce? Weren't there richer moral issues to mine in the creation of the bomb? Politicians. Courtrooms and conference rooms.Murphy was excellent. Robert Downey Jr a disappointment. Blunt did what she could with a small part. Damon lit it up and energized the screen in his small part. Pugh's character inessential to the plot but I guess that's how we got the nudity in?I was really looking forward to this as a Nolan fan and a history lover. What a slog. Do not recommend rushing out to see this. Wait for it to be free on Max.
"This movie is extremely well crafted. From the first second to the last, you are sucked into the life of Oppenheimer. The acting, cinematography and soundtracks are just perfectly harmonious together.Cilian Murphy gives an Oscar-worthy performance that is terrifying yet pleasing to watch. The supporting actors went above and beyond and performed their roles to perfection.What more could one ask for? This is a movie that will be remembered for decades to come. It is a masterpiece crafted by Christopher Nolan that exceeded all my expectations.Watch it in IMAX if you still have the time. You will regret not doing so."
"We are blessed to be alive at the same time this movie has released. This was without a doubt the most majestic movie I have ever seen, the visuals, the dialogue, the cast, the story, ALL OF IT! It really gives you the sense of urgency in the race against the world to be the first to build the bomb. Not only is it entertaining but it will change how you view things. How easy it would be for the world to be destroyed at the push of a button is in a way fascinating but at the same time terrifying. Words do not do this movie justice, go see it for yourself, this is without a doubt Christopher Nolan's best work."
"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.Its a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.I think its over-hyped. The acting is top notch no doubt about it but the screenplay & pacing is really tedious & jumpy."
Nolan's best work since the release of Interstellar. It's a 3 hour long biopic/political drama about J Robert Oppenheimer and Manhattan Project from the beginning of World War 2 to the Cold War. It's a deep dive into the life and mind of Oppenheimer and the circumstances during that era. Some shots are absolutely breathtaking and I'm surprised that not a single one of them was CGI. A true technical achievement. RDJ was absolutely brilliant in every scene he was in as well as other actors. Everyone was cast perfectly. But the jewel in the crown is without a doubt Cillian Murphy. He embodied the role and stole almost every scene he was in with his sheer scene presence and body language. He's definitely getting nominated and possibly winning best actor for this one. Best movie released this year so far.
"A phenomenal watch. It may seem too long but once you are in, you forget everything and the focus is on Murphy. Nolan has given yet another masterpiece. Sound design was fabulous even though there were times when dialogues was overpowered by music.The movie takes you on a journey of Robert Oppenheimer and oh my, it was just amazing.The casting choices were nothing short of brilliant. Christian Bale's portrayal of Oppenheimer was nothing less than extraordinary. He captured the essence of the enigmatic scientist, showcasing his brilliance and inner conflict with remarkable depth and nuance. The supporting cast, including talented actors like Emily Blunt, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Cillian Murphy, delivered performances that were equally captivating and added layers of complexity to the narrative."
"Ok - so watched this yesterday. And there's a lot of negative points about this film, but for me the biggest one was the nuclear explosion itself. There's been so much hype over this in not using CGI etc. But. I could have got the same effect by grabbing a can of petrol and lighting it and filming it in slow motion and passing it off as a nuclear explosion. To say it was a bit crap is an understatement! It's a shame that nobody involved in the making of this film looked at actual footage. And it's not like there isn't enough of it about either, so there's no excuse. The story of Oppenheimer is ok. The story of the science is above par. But so so let down by the scenes of trinity. I wanted my 2 hours plus back by the end."
"I'm writing this review a day after I saw the film, and I'm still in complete awe. Once the credits rolled, I was speechless due to the fact that I realized I just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece in the theaters. The movie is three hours long, but it's tied together neatly and every scene has its purpose. I'm already thinking about when I want to go see it again in theaters.I honestly don't know what the best part of the film is. The directing by Nolan, acting by Cillian Murphy and RDJ, the score, the cinematography, there's just too much to choose from. I've been listening to the score over and over again this morning because it's THAT GOOD. Murphy and RDJ should have no issues with getting Oscar nominations. I only have three 10/10's I've ever given out, Oppenheimer is definitely deserving."
"I am going to start with the only negative things. This film has a high chance of not convincing a huge amount of people. Probably, this isn´t going to be Nolan´s best film mainly because it is a ""simmered film"", three hours long and it can be tedious sometimes. But there is one thing for sure. If you are a cinema lover, you are going to enjoy this masterpiece. The plot, the characters, the explosion.... everything is so well done and there is not one, but two candidates for the oscar: Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. It is unbelivable how they nail their characters in such an special way.My advice is to go to the cinema, buy some popcorns and enjoy this ""3 hours work of art""."
Interstellar was the first movie I saw of Nolan and since then I fell in love with his work and watched his every movie. I was waiting for Oppenheimer since 8-9 months and I was not disappointed the movie was worth every penny the cinematics and the amazing sound quality will make you fall in love with Nolan again and the way he tells the story is truly amazing. This a movie which deserves to be seen only in cinemas the small screen will not to justice to this masterpiece. After the interval the movie becomes so interesting that you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat. I can't wait for Nolan's next movie now and I wish he makes thousand more movies.
"Amazing movie, the best I have seen this year. Nolan keeps high class. I think Oppenheimer will win at least 6 Oscars in 2024. Top class actors, even in episodes - like Gary Oldman, Matt Modine, Casey Affleck, etc. Cillian Murphy played his best role and deserves Oscar. Like Robert Dawney Jr. - his play was outstanding. Christopher Nolan deserves his oscar too. Every film detail is perfect. Here is my opinion regarding Oscars: Best actor - Cillian Murphy, Supporting actor - Robert Dawney Jr., Best directing - Christopher Nolan, Best Picture - Oppenheimer, Best original screenplay - Oppenheimer, Best film editing - Oppenheimer."
"This is the first movie which I am watching in theatres. This is just amazing from starting with black and white colour and then to brightfull this movie has so much to tell. The story tell, build up, different paces, intensed scenes and situation. NOLAN did a great grear job. I was so hyped up for this movie and watched the first day first show and i t was worth it. We all know nolan's cinematography and bgm sound score was so it. My eyes were glued to it. I have enjoyed the movie very much felt the tension between the characters and the cast did such a such a great job Cillian Murphy, RDJ' Emily blunt and Matt Damon I love you all. YOU MADE MY DAY."
"For all you attention-deficit sheep, this is NOT a BOOM-BOOM story about the bomb, it is about the life of the man who created it. And yes, it is three hours long. If this is too much for your cranial bandwidth, go watch Die Hard. Cilian Murphy did an OUTSTANDING job playing a brilliant but tortured physicist. Emily Blunt was amazing as always especially in her testimony on her husband's behalf. A well-told story that takes its time. All-star cast. Gary Oldman makes a brief but important appearance as the narcissistic psychopath war criminal Truman who called Oppenheimer a 'crybaby' for having moral conflicts about designing an instrument that murdered over a quarter of a million innocent human beings. I do wish there would have been much more of a focus on the criminal devastation inflicted upon the people of Japan. Also, deduction for the sex and nudity - WHY do movies do this? Do people enjoy watching depicted sex scenes? If so, why not more scenes of people sitting on toilets? Ridiculous and unnecessary. But all in all a great story. Murphy absolutely deserves an Oscar for this one."
"I would've been good money that this was going to be one of the best movies I'd ever watch. But wow. First, the soundtrack plays *constantly* throughout the entire 3 hours. It never stops, and it's very loud, a true assault of the senses. Second, its pacing is crazy-making slow. Even 20 minutes into it, I was thinking 'this has got to get better, right?' Only it never does. The dialog is difficult to hear (largely over the loud music that never stops), and the storyline is not easy to follow. But besides all this, it's just a shockingly boring movie. I'm a big movie fan, and this will go down as one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
"After reading the reviews prior to seeing the film, it felt as if this flick has divided cinema-goers. Ok, let's deal with the obvious - cast, cinematography and art of telling a story well are very much order of the day, but did it need to be 3hr sitting, probably not.You'd be hard pushed to find a fault with the build but as many have pointed out, the bio pic is more than events of WW2, it questions the fabric of the human soul, morals and ethics along with political and professional upmanship.All in all a super film that proved to be a fascinating watch. Nolan deliverers the goods again."
"To kick things off ! I have to say the visuals and the storyline was very well combined ! I was very well impressed with some of the performances and in particular Emily Blunt Cillian Murphy and most importantly the support actors who had their moment to shine through this movie.They were moments were you feel like it's going to explode but left with an open ended line wondering what's next ! Nevertheless, it was encouraging to see Nolan putting a factual output of Oppenheimer's character and bringing the audience into the shoes of the character. Despite this,the last hour really dragged a bit longer than it should of been but can't take way another masterclass from Nolan !!"
"Real masterpiece. I knew this movie will be a good one, but I didn't expect this... I was felling stress and pressure on my body for 3 hours. For some moments I was forgetting that I'm sitting in cinema and watching a movie. Beautiful experience. Cillian Murphy acting was on top level. I watched thousands of movies in my life, but I never experienced this strange feeling that I was feeling after leaving cinema. This film is telling us a really important story that we shouldn't ever forget. A story about events that happened not so long ago. Story which changed a entire world. I'm waiting for an Oscar for Cillian."
"Excellent film, multilayered as another reviewer put it. I knew the story so the way it moved about from Oppenheimer's early life, the Manhattan Project, his security appeal and the Strauss confirmation hearing was known to me. However that might have been confusing to those who don't know the story. Given where Christopher Nolan is from I was surprised that the huge contribution British and Canadian scientists, among other non-Americans, seemed only to be represented by one of the British delegation who is revealed as a Soviet spy. That's the sort of thing that makes Americans think they ivented everything or won every war by themselves."
"This movie is for audience can always know about it. There some good stuff and more, so we can see about the good movie. I know this movie has good things or bad things, which it is the good thing about the project and a lot stuff. So i did great for the movie. Always know this movie, but there's no problem unless the audience are did good or awesome. Oppenheimer is the good movie. But there's don't allow at school only cuz it is for Mature audience. The sexuality and nudity are good and moderate. Which there's no full frontal nudity or any graphic. Don't worry it also may profanity are good. :)"
"With Oppenheimer, Nolan has created the perfect cinematic cocktail. Outstanding soundtrack, photography, actors and script, all these things that make up the cocktail are worth an Oscar. The performance of each of the actors is impressive, they all create a perfect tune that catches you in the plot. Expectations were extremely high with Cillian Murphy's performance, however he has been able to far exceed them with a superb performance. I have rarely seen an actor interpreting a historical character in such a deep way, in which for a moment you forget that it is Cillian and you really think that you are seeing Oppenheimer on the big screen. This gives a great added value to the film. In my opinion, Oppenheimer falls into Nolan's top 3 films, ranking it in the first place would be somewhat pretentious having only seen it once. Without any doubt in the following weeks I will return to the cinema to see this masterpiece again."
"Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I've ever seen the amazing cast matched with the incredible pacing, writing, cinematography just works like clockwork, I do think the first half is better than the second half mostly because Christopher Nolan is just better with science and the second half of the film ( the aftermath of trinity ) is just mostly politics and Oppenheimer being questioned. But the film is still awesome, Christopher Nolan never fails to impress me just like he did in interstellar, inception, and the prestige. The score was phenomenal but I really wish it had that Hans Zimmer touch to it especially when they tested trinity."
I have seen lots of film in the theatre s and after watching movies or film's you will either happy or sad but when you watch Oppenheimer you will come out thoughtful some thing will barz your head I don't know what will but it will that's is Oppenheimer and Nolan has make movies that are eternal for us but this is something else why it is because this just the biopic of farther of atomic energy but how Nolan hai present it that's was privileged for for all his fan that's why we love Nolan hand's down he is the best directors of our generation there's no comparison what Nolan has given to Film industry Hollywood should thankfull to him that's is it's form my side.
"Within minutes of the movie you will be absorbed into it, mainly due to the stunning sound effects. Murphy has given the performance of his life. Brilliant movie. It explored all aspects including conception, generation, testing, deployment and the aftermath including accusations. No stone was left unturned.Nolan has delivered yet another masterpiece. Special mention fro the sound artists of this movie. This is definitely getting nomination or maybe even winning oscars in these departments
1) murphy acting
2) Nolan direction
3) SOUND ENGINEERINGKeep making such wonderful movies Nolan, more power to you."
"I decided to watch it yesterday, even though it wasn't in IMAX. But like all of Nolan's previous films, his ability to build a story is always intriguing to discuss. Even for a biography film, he managed to turn it into an epic movie that can't be watched just once.I might say this is the biography film with the most realistic set locations I've ever seen. Watching Oppenheimer is like witnessing a classical Mozart piano performance: it's hard to understand if you don't grasp the context behind it. Perhaps in a fictional film, the filmmaker would gladly explain to us what's happening, but a biography assumes that we already understand the subject's background. I might watch it for the second time after relearning the background of J. Robert Oppenheimer."
"Every part of this work of art had so much care, Love and attention put into every little frame of this 3hr long masterpiece, The writing acting and cinematography are phenomenal, But what stands out the most is the sound design/score which is the best in any movie i've ever seen, When the first bomb was detonated it left such a massive amount of time before you felt a shockwave feeling like the bomb had just gone off right next to you, The expressions on the characters faces was of utter dread and horror, The pacing of the movie was slightly slow but not boring at all, The whole film i didn't take my eyes of the screen for a second, 9.8/10."
"Masterpiece. Movie is aboslute masterpiece. Cillian perfomances are stunning. In some parts of movie my heart was beating like it was Oppenheimer myself. That is because Cillian is masterclass actor. Movie is like a fine book or some badass fine wine, 3 hours of this movie fly by like it was 3 seconds. I think that if people is giving less than 10, they are just shittie idots, don't appreciate this movie or they don't have enough knowledge, experience or taste to see when movie is masterpiece. I think the messege is clear with this movie. How rutless world can be, when you are needed country will lick your balls, but once you are not gonna listen orders or having your own opinon. They will eat you alive. So also is with a friends or coworkers because of their own ego and jelousy they will do everthing to see your failure.😄"
"The story was just all over the place. I could barely understand anything the characters were saying, mostly due to the overbearing sound of the score. I can't even begin to say how evil these types of films are to people. Let alone men who watch this thinking that they too can become something of themselves. Of course, Nolan is the most misogynistic he could ever be having women characters who spout about nothing more than Men. It's just pathetic and in no way do I think these films will hold up. Maybe as a means to see some glimpse of a historical event, but nothing more than that. No heart. No thing to latch on to. No interest whatsoever in Nolan's interests at all. I'd rather see Spielberg direct this film, god forbid."
"Only reason why this isn't 10/10 is that for me the camera work is too ""dramatic"". Every 2 seconds the camera shifts and every 3 minutes new scene begins. If the movie wasn't 3h long I would say that I would prefer if they prolonged the scenes and added more detail. I also understand that this works the best when a character is retelling his story and memories, but for me it was a bit too much.Also the huge amount of face close-ups could have been avoided.But except that, I really enojed this movie. The acting, visuals and most important the sound were excellent.(Sorry for my bad English)"
"Before I say my opinion, many people thought that the movie was classified as dynamic and expected fighting scenes, and so on. This is a grave mistake. The movie is a biography, all of it on Robert Oppenheimer. A conversational experience that is one of the most enjoyable. This is the strength of the movie. It is the language of dialogue between the actors. This is the basis of the movie. Not to mention the scenes of the nuclear bomb, which I classify as one of the best scenes that I could have seen in my life, the powerful acting, and more than expected from Robert Downey Jr. The whole experience is more than wonderful, and we must not forget the soundtrack from heaven, and I expect an Oscar for this music."
"OH man, I know I'm going to get thumbs down but I kept checking my watch after the 2 hour, this film really was an auditory assault of tediousness, I think this is an example of a movie that is soooo overhyped, while it was a very good movie, acting great, visuals spectacular, I definitely recommend reading up on who's who, as Nolan goes right into it without giving much of an explanation I think probably about 30 minutes could have been trimmed and it would be fine, also I was lost as these characters breeze right through the dialogue with a LOUD soundtrack playing over them a la Aaron Sorkin (first scene of Social Network) Lastly, also be aware that the black and white scenes are the future while the color scenes are the past."
"I am not really sure how many stars I should give to this movie. As everyone else I was also waiting for a new Nolan movie and the Manhattan project is an interesting topic too. I was tired when I went to the cinema but normally that's not a problem. I still see the film too. This time I fell asleep and I only woke up for the last 20 Minutes. It looked pretentious and boring too, Murphy was never my favourite actor and this film didn't help either, what I saw.I also realised why I don't normally like Nolan's works apart from Inception. The editing is not artistic, not the greatest cinema,just annoying simply.I might watch the whole movie at some point but probably not, unless I have trouble falling asleep."
"The tale of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who oversaw the Manhattan Project to create the atomic bomb, is told in the sweeping, epic movie Oppenheimer. The movie has spectacular visuals that beautifully capture the world of the Manhattan Project. The acting is outstanding, with Cillian Murphy portraying Oppenheimer with a masterful portrayal. The movie is also highly intellectual, diving into difficult philosophical and scientific issues regarding the origins of authority and accountability. Even though ""Oppenheimer"" is not an easy movie to watch, it will stick with you long after you've watched it. Anyone interested in human condition, history, or science ought to study it, in my opinion."
"Just home from viewing #Oppeneheimer at the Omniplex Tralee on a #MAXX screen. Overall I thought it is a fantastic movie. I was glued to my seat for the 3 hours. There was some stunning cinematography especially the Los Alamos site and he really captured the violence of the first explosion at the Trinity site.Cillian Murphy was brilliant as Robert Oppenheimer, but I thought that Robert Downey gave a tour de force performance as Lewis Strauss. I feel that I would have loved the movie even more if Christopher Nolan has explored more of the science behind the bombs. His treatment of the technology behind the bomb was weak and I feel he could have devoted more of the 3 hours of the movie to this aspect."
"Christopher Nolan is a genius on the level of Spielberg and Scorsese. The best anti-war film since Hair and Apocalypse Now. Brilliant Cillian Murphy, Robert Dawney Jr, Emily Blunt and Mat Damon, magnificent acting from all the actors, brilliant direction by Christopher Nolan. Perfect cinematography. Extremely good visual effects. There is not even one thing that irritates you A politically incorrect, stunning. You are speechless after the movie ends. I didn't think Hollywood could make such a worthwhile movie anymore. Will definitely watch it again. It might be the best movie made in the 21st century and hope it's not the last one!"
"Another Nolan masterpiece telling Oppenheimer's story and interweaving 2 different moments in time. Aided by the colour and black/white to contrast the 2 stories, it means you can sit back and relax, and marvel in what is an amazing piece of cinema.Cillian Murphy has the gong in the bag already but so does Nolan surely. The storytelling, direction, attention to detail, cinematography, it's all 10/10.Criticisms? None, only a realisation that I should've brushed up more on history before watching, particularly when you realise there's a whole 3rd act still to go after the bomb is dropped.You know you've been in a marathon when you leave the cinema, but you also know you've witnessed something pretty amazing."
"The movie is very well-written. All casts did their job very well. I could understand the movie even though it's 3 hours long but i was too excited and didn't realize it's actually 3 hours long. It's a movie that made my brain to think but i love it.I think this is a very high quality movie. Watching this movie actually made me think I have used my time wisely. It's a movie that's worth to watch because it's based on true story. By watching this movie, you'll learn history, science, life, and other things I don't know how to describe.Thank you for making this amazing movie.Please watch this movie. I really recommend it."
"Damn, Nolan's still got it. Dunkirk is kinda slept on, and Tenet got some weird crap it didn't deserve. But as far as general consensus goes, Interstellar was Nolan's last masterpiece, coming out nearly a decade ago. And now there's Oppenheimer. What a revelation. Insanely tense, dramatic, with masterful acting; literally not a single misstep. The writing is somehow at a breakneck pace throughout the whole thing, simply because there is so much to cover, but the density doesn't dilute the film in any way. Every beat, moment, and scene builds and unfolds in the exact way that it needs to for the perfect shot, outcome, and progression. What an addition to Nolan's filmography. A monumental achievement for a behemoth of this industry."
"It was perfect. Perfect. Everything, to the last minute detail. Nolan was not kidding when he said that the movie was going to be bomb (literally).The screenplay and the cast selection, the writing, the delivery, the shooting. No words. I believe that there isn't any other movie that can compete with the craze and the movie itself. The only downside is that you can loose track of the movie if you don't stay focused.Seeing Robert Downey JR after endgame was really a sight for sore eyes, and the chemistry between all of the characters was something unreal!Summing it up, this is definitely a must watch along with Barbie (Oppenheimer better)."
"Give everyone involved an oscar already!! Truly a masterclass.Intense in the best way (that score, my god it was incredible), so emotionally charged and not overtly long despite about 40%-60% of scenes being dudes talking science in front of a black board. Also the way it effortlessly moves between time periods while taking the time to let the story unravel naturally was perfect.Definitely worth seeing in imax if you can, the sound and cinematography were both stunning.This is a movie that leaves you thinking. I couldn't stop talking about it with my friend despite being so tired after the movie let out at 1am. Woke up thinking about it. Want to rewatch it. That speaks to how good it is."
"Big Nolan fan here, but I was overall disappointed in the film, I think I had too higher expectations going into it. The film had some absolutely amazing moments in these short spans which I loved to bits...and then would revert to a slow movie where the pacing wasn't great. The film felt like it dragged a little to fill up the 3 hour runtime.That being said, the acting was phenomenal and use of special effects over visual effects was great to watch. The soundscape is just what to expect from a Nolan film, with a good soundtrack and great sound effects. I would recommend watching the film with a good sound system for the best experience. I really wanted to love this movie, but just was uninteresting in some area's of the movie."
Chernobyl on Max is a thousand times better than this scam of a movie. Perfect example of false advertising. They keep it fast paced so you'll be tricked into thinking its a good movie. Probably a suggestion by the studio so audiences don't lose interest. Cillian Murphy is a great actor. That's the only positive thing i have to say about this boring garbage. All the cameos are out of place along with the sex scenes. Nolan should never be allowed to cast another movie. He got lucky with Heath Ledger. If you liked this movie then you're pretentious and a sucker. 20 year old documentaries on the subject are more interesting. If want a Nolan/atom bomb sized explosions...you'll be very disappointed. I'm depressed at the thought of Barbie probably being a better movie. I look forward to your downvotes.
"Got the chance to watch Oppenheimer in imax during a quick stopover in Vienna today. Nolan's characteristic multi timeline strikes in maybe his most perfect fashion yet, brought to life by one of the best (and absolutely stacked) casts I've had the joy to appreciate in a long time. It is more of an essay on humanity than anything else, leaving you sitting in your seat lost in thought long into the credits.I wouldn't say imax is essential and I felt the pacing at the start was a bit quick for the circumstances but even still it is so much more than the already outstanding marketing gives it credit.Having the entire 400 strong crowd dead silent for the equally silent climax of the film was pretty special. Easily one of my favourite cinema experiences."
"I'm still thinking of words and ways to describe what this move accomplishes. It's long, but you don't feel like it. The story is so compelling, and the movie so we'll executed, that you want it to take long, you want it to be exactly what it is: a masterpiece.I've been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's work and Cillian Murphy's acting for a while now, and even though I had high expectations, what they did with this film was above and beyond.You're drawn to the story, there's an emotional connection to the characters, and what a way to describe something that really happened, which I didn't know about in details.This is a must watch. Truly enjoyable, nail-biting, intense and rewarding experience."
"A film written and directed by the legendary Christopher Nolan. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. I added synopsis here so I can fill up the limit met, lol. This is from Wiki btw""now I'm become death, the destroyer of worlds"" this line of Oppenheimer revolved down the aspect of the movie's story. I don't want to spit anything about the film but what can I say is, amazing, just amazing. Imagine leaving the theater feeling empty and stunned that you don't know what you wanna express. Its that kind of feeling."
"Never before had such a shiver run through my body. The ending is completely shocking, you don't understand what you feel. Those emotions are conveyed so vividly, as if you are experiencing everything yourself. Only Christopher Nolan could make such a powerful film. The music especially adds strength to the film. The actors are chosen perfectly. I can't think of another actor who could play Oppenheimer. It may not be for everyone, but it's a must-see for everyone. I saw the movie in the cinema and I recommend everyone to see it in the cinema because it's a completely different feeling than watching it at home on TV."
"Simply extraordinary, a film that goes beyond the historical part about the creation of the atomic bomb, emphasizes Oppenheimer's character, his emotions and the terrible remorse that led him to face a terrible situation with the government that turned its back on him. A very powerful film, very deep in what it seeks to express and with one of the most epic endings in the history of cinema.Simply extraordinary, a film that goes beyond the historical part about the creation of the atomic bomb, emphasizes Oppenheimer's character, his emotions and the terrible remorse that led him to face a terrible situation with the government that turned its back on him.

"Like literally amazing, this movie is fantastic the direction, cinematics, acting and each scene of this movie is thrilling. Great storyline and original story too was depicted really well. The originality and quality of this movie is what makes it the best. Its difficult to understand at start but if u have interest in this field, then this movie feels awesome!!Just go and watch it and enjoy the experience!!If u dont have any prior knowledge to the story I would indeed advise people to just watch a short documentary or a youtube video before the movie as it will help u more to understand the plot and experience the movie even more!!!!!!!!"
I have watched this movie with my friends. Most of them got bored all the way throughout the movie.they did not understand the science and history behind all of this. But for me this was something different than other drama war documentaries. This was thought provoking one.we got to understand the Oppenheimers point of view and what a nuclear weapon can do. If it was not then someone sure have used atleast once nuclear bomb. We got to learn the history n power politics at that time. How scientists can change the war scenarios. How spies played their role in nuclear chase. It was so much to understand and comprehend for future generations.
"Once again Nolan doesn't disappoint fascinating movie it is, I have to say the Pacing it's brilliant should watch it in theatres. It's complete biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer it's based on his life and the fact Nolan used a real atomic bomb was a life time moment to see and experience it in the theatres if you're a Nolan fan who likes action time to time i might say it's different with Oppenheimer so heads up, but the plot twist was really good damm, like it's good and hats off to top notch acting Cillian Murphy did don't worry he will get the Oscar for sure , You will not see Cillan Murphy you will see Oppenheimer in real life that was the experience for me probably he was Oppenheimer in his past life. I hope this review will lead you to watch the cinema."
"Definitely one of the best movies I've ever watched. The soundtrack in Nolan's movie is always the best, same for this movie. The way the scenes were arranged made me go deep into the plot. All the cast members were also at their best in acting, particularly Cillian Murphy. I hope he wins academy award as the best actor for this work. Some people might say the movie was too long for them, but I think each and every scene was made to be as short/fast paced as possible. If this movie were made shorter than this, it won't be as good as it is now. I will definitely suggest watching the movie if you can. During watching the movie if you think it's too long, just hold on your patience. If you can't keep your patience, good movies are not for you."
"A truly powerful film about the development of the most powerful bomb of its time. Cillian Murphy delivers a career best performance as the timid J Robert Oppenheimer. This is definitely a film you want to see on the biggest screen near you. It is well worth the extra ticket price. A visually stunning movie that takes advantage of every inch of the screen. The film explores the complex Manhattan project, which produced the worlds first atomic bomb. Christopher Nolan is a mature filmmaker at this point in his career and it shows, as he weaves through the complex (and perhaps slightly too long) story. He absolutely nails the ending however, and the final scene of the movie really stuck with me. Overall a strong 9/10."
"I've seen Oppenheimer yesterday and I can say it's without a doubt one of Nolan's best ever! It's a very complicated film, which is sometimes difficult to understand (especially in the beginning) - but you'll get rewarded at some point and all of your questions disappear!It is not a film for those, who just want to be entertained by as many explosions as possible (it's not a Micheal Bay film 😅) It's a film for people, who are really in love with cinema and great storytelling, and this is what you'll get here!It's a 3-hours biopic, but it felt much shorter and I wanted to see it another hour!Now I only want to say: Go and watch it in the theaters and be existed about all the thing you're going to experience! It is something else! 🙌🏻"
"Oppenheimer was absolutely phenomenal. It is hard to know exactly how I am going to deal with having seen it, probably by seeing it again and again. Having seem it in IMAX (as it is supposed to be viewed) was totally worth it.I assume those who see it are fairly familiar with at least the broad storyline which makes it better when you now get to see it from Oppenheimer's own perspective. You get to follow his experiences regarding the process and see how it affects him as a person.The acting, the writing, the score... everything was done to perfection and Cillian Murphy should be praised for his portrayal of this troubled physicist. The only thing I have to say to those who have not yet seen it is: do it."
"It is the weakest movie of Christopher Nolan but it is still watchable and far better than many movies that came this year and previous years. Thanks to its bgm. Feels like suspense Horror movie, but it's not. Nothing much to say about it's acting. Nothing extra ordinary. Story is Bah. Nothing that you may find exciting. Best thing in entire movie is the bgm. Save your money and watch in ordinary screen, no need of going for IMAX. It's a dialogue heavy and totally a dialogue driven movie. Don't expect great visual as per the current going hype. It's a overhyped movie. Weakest work of Nolan. I think it's the topic or the theme of this movie. What else can you expect. Nolan tried to do his best. Unlike other Nolan movies, It is just, One time watch only, strictly."
"The first two hours were disjointed and annoying at times ... rapid and awkward scene changes, unrelated cuts to different story threads that had no sense of connection or relevance at times. There were story elements in the first half that could have easily been left out, there was no need to make this movie 3 hours long. It should have been about quality, not quantity. However with all that said, the last hour of this movie rescued what could have been a disaster. It was brilliant, dramatic and intense, Nolan at his best in my opinion. It left me feeling that it had been a worthwhile movie-going experience despite the lack of coherence in the first two hours."
"Oppenheimer, the man that changed the world forever. This movie is incredible let me just say. From the screenplay, characters, actors, all the way to the sound design, costumes, and set design. All the little details are there, Christopher Nolan doesn't miss a single one at all. Nolan delivers a force to be reckoned with, easily the best movie of 2023. I've never been so moved and touched by a film of this caliber in a while. Nolan isn't the only human to deliver a masterpiece for this film. Cillian Murphy nails it as J. Robert Oppenheimer, his acting is beyond brilliant. Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr also stand out majorly in this film for me as I find their performances as captivating as Murphy's. In summary, this film is detailed to the brim, the acting is beyond incredible, and the film is one of the ages. One of the absolute best films this generation will have and one of absolute greatest movies I'll ever see in my entire life."
"The only downfalls of Oppenheimer come in some of the editing (please editors, let some of these moments breathe) and the near constant score. Some more times of quietness would be good. Otherwise, a terrific watch and a movie future generations should see.The entire cast provide meaningful, emotional and genuine performances. Cillian Murphy is incredible in the lead, giving us a true anchor for our journey into the world of atomics and quantum physics. The cinematography is incredible, depicting the scope and grandeur Christopher Nolan is known for. The sound design too was incredible, all sounding authentic and perfectly matched to what was on screen."
"I mean I don't know what most people saw here, but this was a bore fest. Amazing cast, great acting , superb cinematography and sound. But that's about it. Except few moments in the movie, rest was complete borefest. Half my theater was sleeping after 45 minutes. Werner Brothers might buy some reviewers to give great reviews and Nolan fan boys might go ga ga over it,.but that's usual with most of his movies. Box office, it won't last over few days.I mean majority history of the atomic bomb was left put. The challenges with the actual science, material, building up those towns , the race for the bomb . Nothing. All interesting things were left put and the movie focuses on boring tale of oppenheimers trial. Seriously. You missed the most interesting part of that history."
"Really. A movie that is just nonstop talking will fly by to a confusing point. How did I just see all that and ingest it all in 3 hours and it's like the previews just ended? The people who thought it dragged on forever... I mean... are you trying to make Americans look stupid? I usually really, no matter what, can barely make a 2.5 hour film without getting restless. That would include other Nolan films (all of which are great). This goes by faster than a kid's 75 minute movie as long as you know it's a biopic. Now that should be apparent based on the description of this movie being a biopic of Robert Oppenheimer, but I digress.It's my new favorite movie of all time and a film professor's wet dream. Nothing like it ever made or ever will be. I would liken it almost to a non mocumentary Citizen Kane. Can't wait to see it again."
I can't type straight after watching this masterpiece by the great Christopher Nolan. The presentation of the story was out of this world. At the end I was horrified by the reality of this film. Cillian Murphy gave one of the best performances I have ever seen of a conflicted man who tried his best to choose the lesser evil and failed. And how masterfully Nolan captured it. Every explosion shook the soundboxes in the hall and made me realise and feel the dread of the Atomic Bomb. Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr were fabulous. One of the greatest and most important movie I have ever seen. Mind blowing experience and a dream come true.
"Oppenheimer did not disappoint. It told the story of his life, the before and after, the good and the bad. It was just absolutely brilliant. Hands down, would watch it again. The score was beautifully matched to every moment, some scenes were a bit heavy because you can feel how the characters felt. The culminating of actors in the entire movie was surprising, I had no idea that many big name actors were going to be in it, I personally could've done without some he chose, but that didn't stop me from watching and loving every second of the cinematic masterpiece. You can never go wrong with Nolan's story telling, it keeps you drawn to the screen the entire time."
"Oppenheimer is long and boring, editing is confusing mixing 3 periods, that sometimes you don't recognize, which is before which one.I was misleaded by the trailer about what would come in the movie, Robert Downey Jr is difficult to recognize at first, but is playing well as a 2nd role.I would preferably recommend to the people interested by ""Project Manhattan"", the movie ""Fat Man and Little Boy ""Les Maîtres de l'Ombre"" from Roland Joffé, which will learn you more about scientific details than ""Oppenheimer"" which is more a biopic and take too much time on political theater against communism, which much too long unuseful dialogs."
"Simply put, one of the greatest movies ever made as it's a warning to everyone in IT - especially those working on Social Media & AI. It's a cross between Schindler's List & The Imitation Game. Prepare to need to drink heavily after viewing!. You do not wet to see this late in the day as you will think about it for hours afterwards. It is very science heavy and requires you to pay attention. Personally I don't think IMAX is needed for this but absolutely a theatre with good sound is a must. This is not only the best picture of 2023, it's one of the greatest films of all time. But I never need to see it again!"
"The best biography movie ever, I don't know where to start, but everything in this movie was great, the voices, the performance of the actors, the music, the directing in manipulating the time line, and the method of narration. I never imagined that I would watch a biographical film with this much enjoyment, even though the film was long, It was three hours, but I did not feel it because it was fast and fun. Everything was great and it is considered an injustice if the movie got less than two Oscar. In the end, I want to say that Mr. Christopher Nolan presented us with a wonderful and unforgettable cinematic masterpiece, and every time he directs a movie, he raises the ceiling of challenges and makes things difficult for the rest of the directors."
"Oppenheimer ended with me wishing it was longer. The characters, acting, music, effects, writing were all classic Nolan at his best. Steeped in paradox and multi-layering, this watched like a documentary but with pure drama. The only reason I gave it an 8 and not a 9 or 10 is because i wanted more ""standard"" storytelling like a clear hero/villain but that's not what you get with Oppenheimer. It's a wrestling match the whole movie, a storm of intelligence, morality, ego, power, greatness, and love all swept up into one man. Nobody wins when it comes to weapons of mass destruction. Wonderful lines. Historical precision. Robert Downey Jr. Was brilliant."
"Masterpiece would be an understatement for this film. The intense moments that hooked us to the seats 🔥. Music, performance, Direction , cinematography ellam 10/10 . The only slight issue was the duration but Nolan makes it very engaging aakkum . A must watch theatrical experience. I dont think this would wirk out if you watch it in your mobile phones, laptops . It should be experienced in a movie theatre. I wouldn't say Imax if you have the cash go watch it in IMAx but i watched it in a normal theatre but the impact was beyond words . The middle portion the trinity test scene is worth all the money you pay for . Overall a brilliantly directed and executed Cinema."
"Hard to concentrate on the fast moving but perfectly constructed screenplay as Cilligan's azure eyes are possibly more mesmeric than Peter O'Toole's Laurence. He displays the contradictions 'Oppie' perfectly; the scientist, the agitator, the womanizer, the friend. Despite not knowing a positive proton if it bit me, the film is highly doable, and the whole cast delivers on drama and character, thete's not one bum note. Aside from the main lead, there are stellar turns from Robery Downey Jr., Matt Damon, & Emily Blunt, the first I might say, should garner some quality nominations and it's a joy to see this actor clearly working at the top of his game. You should enjoy this film very much."
"I watched it in IMAX with my cousin. I imagined I would be bored at some point of the movie somewhere but the progression of the general plot and the scenario was so smooth I couldn't get the chance to get bored. My cousin said the same thing. Truly one of the greatest cinema experiences of my life. The acting was perfect in my opinion, great actors with great performances, every scene felt like a video clip from the past.Literally every scene looks and feels like you are there watching from the corner. The sets, lighting and the camera work is impecable.Ludwig Görensson wrote the perfect scores for the constantly building up tension and stress throughout the movie.10/10 definitely would watch again and again."
"The internet created a huge hype about this movie. The Bomb and Nolan maybe the reason. In the movie, there was more dialogues (especially in the train which doesn't made any sense) than the making of the bomb. The cinematographer was descent and Nolan did well. Murphy carried the whole movie. There was some miscasts but overall an average movie. The bomb test was a great experience, didn't expected it. It was like a biopic and anyone cam enjoy the movie with proper knowledge about Oppenheimer. People may watch the movie more than one time to understand the storyline. Just have to say that people expected more from Nolan."
"The character assassination of Julius Robert Oppenheimer is a much described and debated subject, and it's basically also what this film is about, I think, and little about nuclear bomb making. Nevertheless, though it's nearly three hours long, director Christopher Nolan still tries to fill the plot with more than is possible, and the results is that it stylistically appears like an endless trailer, where the editing and the jumping in time looks more like a long music video than an epic film. At times it becomes distressing to watch, and it's a great relief when this cannonade of pictures takes breaks in a few longer and slower sequences. If the intention has been to illustrate the main character's inner life during the process, it's perhaps reasonable, but this great topic would probably fit better as a mini series. However, Cillian Murphy makes the very best out of it as Oppenheimer, and despite the aggressive editing he manages to build a credible character. Sadly it doesn't work too well for several other characters, who also are more or less miscasted."
As soon as I saw the trailer for this from Avatar I was on the hype train for this film. I watched this in Imax last night and I can confirm the hype for this film was real. This is without a doubt the best ive seen in recent memory. Soundtrack could be nolens best. It fit the atmosphere of this film perfectly. The acting is incredible. The story telling is perfectly put together. For 3 hours of dialogue I was engaged frame to frame from this film. This is Cillian Murphys best acting to date. He carries this whole film and all the supporting actors do their job and drag you into the world they are living in. Go see this at the theaters. Whatever sound system you have at home wont do this film justice!
"I think it goes without saying that Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and one of only a handful who could have pulled off this feat. This is a perfect biopic. The juxtaposition of the three main points of view (the events leading to Trinity, Oppenheimer's security clearance hearing, and the (failed) confirmation hearing of Strauss) were perfectly entwined. The pacing was excellent. It's a pretty solid bet that this will take home many trophies on Oscar night. For me, the sure winner will be Robert Downey Jr. For his nuanced portrayal of Strauss. Well worth seeing on the big screen."
"It was nice to see a film made for people past puberty. Even better was the acting - while some 'stars' were recognizable,others submerged their personal to the story. The story was ambiguous, as was the history and the impact on the world. And the opening, which tries to convey thought per se, is stunning. I saw the 35mm film, which was how the director wanted it to be shown and the imagery was overwhelming; merely imagining living with these thoughts is humbling.There is no gore or bloodshed, no overt violence, just the barbarism of humans, whether from incinerating weapons or devastating pieces of paper, or calculated betrayal and jealousy. This is the best film of the year."
"This film exceeded my expectations. I have never felt so alive, attentive and engaged in a film for three hours in so long. I have to give it ti Mr Nolan, he has created yet again, another masterpiece of a film. I also should point out the music. As much as I thin Hans Zimmer is one of the greatest composers, Ludwig Göransson couldn't have done a better job than he did on Oppenheimer. The score mad meme feel ways I have never felt before, and the build up to the trinity test was an experience I wish I could endure again for the first time. Everyone should see this film, it is what cinema and storytelling is all about, and this (as a filmmaker myself) has boosted me to be more imaginative."
"Christopher Nolan's latest masterpiece, Oppenheimer narrates the most horrifying historical truth and an exceptional scrutiny. Robert Oppenheimer, who built the atomic bomb, uses his genius-level mind, focusing merely on theory and not paying much attention to the deadly consequences. In the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki apocalypse, he makes his best to clear his conscience. Oppenheimer stands out as one of the most important films of this season. There is only one flaw comes along with Nolan's choice of nonlinear story telling which dilutes the catharsis effect. Considering Christopher Nolan's filmography, we are lucky to have him as brilliant director following the paths of Kubrick."
"My rating is based on the experience I had(duh!!). I should say, my expectation were larger than the h bomb itself. The xenon IMAX experience i can say was sub par and that seriously affected my viewing experience. Nevertheless the tightness of the dramatic story telling made me hooked to the screen with unflinching attention. Not even the loud snoring of my neighbouring seat fella could divert my attention. Cilian's best performance till date and an equally matchingnone by RDJ too. The movie rightly leaves an afterthought which is indeed a horror of sorts. Nothing so visibly horrific, but an underthemenof horror in it's telling. I seriously wish I had a 70 mm IMAX in my country to experience this in it's full glory. Defenitely missed out on that part. Nolan's take on a biopic in his narrative style and prowess of movie making defenitely makes this one of the best biopics in the history of cinema. I am itching for a re-watch in a better IMAX screen."
"This was my highest anticipated movie of the year and it absolutely met my expectations. Long runtime, but to me, it didn't feel like it dragged at all due to the fast pacing of the movie. Movie should be nominated for several awards including best actor, supporting actor, cinematography, score, director and film. Do not go into this expecting a typical Christopher Nolan film like the dark knight or inception, this is telling the story of Oppenheimer and his life and development of the bomb. But for a movie with no action at all, I felt gripped from beginning to end and that's why Nolan is showing that he's one of the best directors to do it. And when the bomb drops.....oh wow, the tension was through the roof! A lot of reviews have been stating ""most important film of the decade"" they may be right. This and the Dark Knight, are my two favorite Nolan films, but this may be his defining masterpiece."
Robert Downey Jr said see Oppenheimer in IMAX so I did. It cost extra to see it in IMAX so probably just a way for Nolan to make more money. Because it was not worth it. I was in row H and I kept walking up and up the stairs and it was the very top row. So I don't feel I got any benefit of seeing it in IMAX as I was that far away from the screen. The movie itself: so extremely boring. What was the point of it? To show how Oppenheimer was persecuted in the 50s over Communism? Who wasn't? Big deal. I could not wait for it to be over. It was hard to follow what was going on with so many characters. It took a lot of concentration to follow what was going on and all we wanted to see was the explosion. The only plus of this movie was seeing what was under those taped spots on the test bomb (and I'm not telling because that was the only interesting part of this movie). What a waste of 3 hours. Read all about it on Wikipedia and save your money. It's not worth it. But I am sure it will win lots of Oscar's. The boring movies always do.
"The cinematography is fascinating. The acting is brilliant. Murphy is astonishing. I knew he was great but this I did not expect. The pace is completely on point. Unbelievable how so much intense and relevant information gets dropped in seamless conversations. I consume so many series and films that I sometimes forget what makes movies truly great. Compared to everything I have seen in the last 2 years, this is a complete masterpiece. Even though it is very long, I feel like Christopher Nolan never loses the viewers attention. The only down part to me is, it is not a movie you can enjoy more than once. But other than that. Loved it."
"Having loved Cillian Murphy for his portrayal as Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders, I was so thrilled when I first heard he would be playing Oppenheimer. I think I first heard about it in 2021, or 2022, either way I couldn't wait to watch this movie. And I am sooo impressed with how it turned out. Though long, it kept me captivated all throughout. I didn't want to miss a minute. Excellent performances by Blunt and Downey but of course Cillian stole the show for me. What an incredible performance as Oppenheimer. I'm so glad that Cillian is finally receiving the recognition he SO DESERVES. If he had social media I'd be spamming him telling him how amazing he is lol.I truly pray he gets an Oscar for his role. He genuinely deserves it."
"A very great movie but you have to focus because the scenes are short and move very quickly and you need prior knowledge of the characters and the story. You can watch a YouTube video explaining it, Nolan excelled in this movie, as well as Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., It should be in the list of the 40 best films of all time at least The cinematography was the greatest thing I've seen in cinema, as if I was looking through a window, as if a nuclear explosion occurred in front of me, I only wished for more appearances of the greatest scientific mindset in human history, Albert Einstein....."
"I'm just coming from the cinema and boy, was this a drag. Long, dull and unexciting. You had one job, Nolan, do a great a-bomb explosion. Show, don't tell us how powerful it is. Show, don't tell us about the devastations in Japan. Show, don't tell us how remorseful Oppenheimer is after the bombings. It's all talk and nothing visually exciting to warrant a cinema visit. I'm not surprised by the low box office results of this movie. Sure, it's filmed well, lots of stars in it, but it's the wrong movie to make, it is very boring and way too long. We were 11 people, everyone was disappointed and one of the girls feel asleep multiple times, while others, including me, were constantly looking at their watches.Anyway, you are warned. Now I'm getting back to studying Sanskrit."
"I've waited for this movie from the day it was announced mostly because Nolan was directing it. Although I'm a big sucker for documentaries and biopics and this movie really stands out and is really one of the greatest. While I was expecting it to be a little bit over the top with the blasts and bombings because of what it is based on and Nolan kind of has an expertise in it duh. But it justifies its name and makes sure it revolves around the Man who created it all in the first place and about his internal battles and psyche and it does that beautifully, by revolving in different timelines but still managing the constant tension in the movie is so great. The cast was out of this world and tells us that how great acting and good writing can make a movie a zillion times better than a CGI-based mindless action piece of junk."
"I have no critics for this film, but I have a good idea. After Oppenheimer, please make after-oppenheimer sequel film with the story of every country involved in world war 2. For example, Japan 1, Indonesia 1, United Kingdom 1. Later, the story of all countries would be met in Oppenheimer 2. Oppenheimer 2 is a film with a story of what if World War 3 happens, where every country that joined the war is fought using nuclear weapons.This is a briliant filmmaking. Oppenheimer respectively guides audience to the story by some visual clues but they have to get to grips with these quickly. This is the worth film to be given an Oscar."
"Oh my god this is the best movie I have ever watched , every thing is a masterpiece from directing to audio editing and the soundtrack obviously , and Christopher Nolan pushed the limits with his talent and passion , and the cast has Robert Downey Jr. Which he played his character with great talent after he played Ironman for a decade , and Cillian Murphy killed it in this movie and he finally deserved the role of a life time after his association with Christopher Nolan from previous movies , but the thing is I think you should absolutely watch this film. It's one of the best movies ever and you have to watch it in IMAX film or with laser , it's gonna be an experience and this movie is the movie of a decade and it's an experience not just movie. I'm just gonna end this right here. Thanks for reading."
"'Oppenheimer' is a near psychedelic collage of a film. It's edited in a dizzying fashion, and it manages to maintain its propulsion for its entire 3 hour run time. It's a biopic that utilizes the cinematic language of thrillers and action films, as well as grace notes that remind one of a more impressionistic indie movie story telling. It turns the historical character of Oppenheimer in to a morally complex sort of tragic super hero (similar to Nolan's Dark Knight films), who dons a fedora and a phallic pipe the way Batman does a cape and mask. It's pure Christopher Nolan and it may be the director's crowning achievement."
"Oppenheimer simply put is just a great movie in every aspect, be it the performance, cinematography and the background score is something we need to experience at IMAX theatre and anything less would be injustice to yourself. Watching the movie we feel gifted to experience the actors perform and gives us a stellar performance. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Florence and Robert Downey Jr are a simply a treat to watch.For the last couple of years we had endure a painful series of movies by Disney and Marvel under James Gunn(with an exception to the movie 'Joker') and now finally we get to see a movie that balances out the time we wasted on these movies.Thank you Mr. Christopher Nolan for allowing us to experience your movie."
Oppie is one of the most mysterious person in his real life and even with script his is the one who created the atomic bomb ...Nolan is going to win a Oscar for this film you'll all see that :)) he have a little bit music thing but i hope he will fix that in the future the cinematography is amazing as nolan always promised us he is trying even harder to get the more people to cinema in this hard circumstances around the world i hope nolan a the film will get an Oscar.The crew of the film the actors are amazing each one them did his job as well as he can specially Chillian murphy i hope he will also get an Oscar.
"As a spectator you need to stay focused as the story jumps back and forth in time in dense and packed dialogues.From a cinematic perspective this is a fantastic movie. The sound effects of the trinity test, the tension build in the storyline, the acting performances are all great.The storyline stays close to the actual events and that makes it also very predicable and -dare I say it- a bit boring. There is hardly an element of surprise although Nolan tries to do this with a discussion between Einstein and Oppenheimer in the beginning. I consider it is more a well filmed documentary where some things are dramatized.Nevertheless, still worth to see in the cinema."
"Surely this movie is not for everyone. You have to connect with each and every character to understand and enjoy the full movie. All the actors has done their job quite passionately and last but not the least the movie will be remembered for its Screenplay, Acting, Direction, editing and Sound effects.. There are certain times in the movie there will be complete blank and you will only hear the person's breath.. There are multiple high profile actors in the movie and only Nolan can justify all the actors in a single movie.. People who thinks it's an action or thriller movie, will be disappointed..In one word it's an extravagant...!!!"
"To prepare for Oppenheimer I did everything wrong; I read 100 pages of American Prometheus, I listened to the soundtrack of The Last Samurai and Interstellar, and I expected too much.After leaving the cinema, I walked to a park and sat on a bench for an hour watching the sun set. It's summer but it feels like autumn here in London. I went home and drank a lot of vodka. It helped me pick my head off the floor. Something felt terrible, or maybe terribly unusual, inside me and I couldn't figure out what. How did a movie MOVE me like this? Only real death has shaken me like this before. So many questions I've been left with, but no answers... and so I must see it again!!!Bravo."
"Hats off to Christopher Nolan. Murphy is living in thé character . No one can replace Murphy , really awesome. Nolan Murphy combination is extraordinary .Each and every scenes shows the professional movie shots. And some science theories is hard to understand in this movie especially the normal guys like me, except its all beautifully made. Its really good experience in IMAX digital. Not fully shot on IMAX but worth watching in IMAX. And for Indians I think its censored about 5-10mins. Must watch movie if you are a movie lover and experience it in IMAX for its fully immersive visual and sound experience."
"The movie begins (literally) with a bang, and ends the same. In between I watched with amazement as the first 70mm IMAX movie I've seen blowing me away with visuals and sounds and emotions I've never quite felt in a theater before. This movie is an experience unlike all others I've seen in my life.I'm not a critic. I'm not here to break down the themes of science or morality. I'm here to tell you to watch this movie on the biggest, best screen you can and let yourself be absorbed by it.The one thing I can assure you is you need to see this at the theater. There is no way this is going to have the same visual effect at home. Do yourself a favor see it now."
"One of the best movies in the industry, Nolan one again demonstrates his intelligence and imagination, visually and narratively the movie was a masterpiece.

"The movie is impeccable. The explosion scene was so beautiful and terrifying so I couldn't even breathe. Cast's effort is just perfect, director's effort is glorious and great. Christopher Nolan is the best director of modern cinema, only few can be with him on the same stage. Cillian Murphy must have his Oscar for this, it was just perfect. The most thrilling and beautiful moment was in the end, when whole audience just started the applause. I will never forget this movie and this IMAX experience. I highly recommend EVERYONE to watch it in IMAX, drive somewhere, If you don't have IMAX in your town."
"I always like to consider what directors decide to do when it comes to post production on epics like this. Some directors will choose to use music sparingly, while in some movies, although rare, the director opts to have no music at all. This one not only has music throughout, it is also loud and melodramatic, playing like a Dodge Ram commercial, for three very long hours.The story is quite compelling, but told in fits and starts, and certainly in a non-linear direction. The acting is solid, the distractions many. I would have liked it more with about 25 minutes less footage and a lot less music.Overall a good film but be prepared for the long haul and some occasional glances at your watch."
"Well, Nolan does it again! And in a different way than his previous work. While his other movies, like The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and Tenet have a lot of action, this film strays away from that (in a good way). By the end, their were two important things that I took from this movie. #1) It was basically all dialogue and score. With that being said, it's also a picture perfect example on how a movie can be so enthralling with just those two things. #2) I'm predicting some Oscar nominations in the future, specifically from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and RDJ. More specifically, the last 30 minutes belong to Cillian and Robert's acting! Hats off to them! While it does certainly feel like the entire 3 hours, it will instantly grab your attention and never backs down. I encourage every cinema lover to see this film on the biggest screen possible!!"
"This captivating movie boasts a compelling storyline, especially if you're familiar with the renowned figures connected to the field of physics. Its intriguing plot kept me engaged throughout, and I genuinely believe that any attempt to shorten it would have undermined its impact. What struck me the most was its profound relevance to the current concerns surrounding artificial intelligence and ChatGPT. The movie left me awestruck, pondering the potential consequences of advancing technology. It paints a vivid picture of a future where humanity might be like two scorpions in a cage if we let conflicts escalate. Thought-provoking and riveting, this film leaves an indelible mark, urging us to reflect on the path our world is taking."
"Visuals, fantastic. Acting, great. Plot, lacklustre. Was a long watch being 3+ hours, could definitely have been portrayed closer to 2 hours instead. There's a lot of talking and for me, not enough concentrating on the physical creation of the bomb (which would break up all the talking scenes). I also didn't really notice a massive difference in IMAX to that of a standard showing, bar the 'bomb' scene. It's a worth a watch once but won't go back for a second viewing. Definitely my least favourite film from Nolan unfortunately.Also a little worrying seeing these 'best film ever watched' reviews! I know the 2023 standard of films has been poor but still!"
"Such a disappointment. The movie is too long and dwells on the security clearance issue in a melodramatic and disjointed way. What did we know about Oppenheimer at the conclusion? He was a tortured soul. He liked women and was a genius. Did we feel compassion or sympathy for him? No. The over arty editing didn't help, neither the jarring score which punctuated scenes. The audience is left none the wiser about the 'Father of the bomb' nor his motivation or humanity. Clever word play and lingering shots of Murphy wearing the signature wide brimmed hat won't make up for the deficiencies. Such a shame."
"Storyline is quite good. Compared to the films of Christopher Nolan in this movie the coordination, vividity and balance of music/bgm was greatly done. The whole movie from start to end has bgm, only 2min after the scene of bomb there is silence. The time period is shown with minute details. Transition of black and white scenes is a great way to show two scenarios at a time. Scenes and there cuts are wonderfully taken. You will not feel any abrupt shot or moment. Not a single scene is wasted to elongate the movie. Overall the acting of each actor was exceptional especially the protagonist himself 'Cillian Murphy'."
"This is cinema! For me, this is Nolan's most impactful masterpiece. It is without a doubt the best adaptation of a book I have ever seen. The story is portrayed in an incredible, tense and dynamic way. I like the fact that it is dynamic because it manages to hold the viewer well even in moments that would be calmer or even a little boring in other stories, but here everything is done very well for you to hold. One thing that helps to keep you hooked is the incredible interpretation of the actors, giving life and high realism to their characters and I especially highlight Cillian Murphy who is the soul of Oppenheimer. The film manages to convey the feeling of the scene very well, especially seconds before the explosion, making us feel in the protagonist's shoes and what helps is the fact that Nolan has not used any CGI the whole film, so it makes us anxious for the result as well as Oppenheimer and his co-workers."
"Nolen's newest movie comes with a great many strengths: amazing actors, intriguing storytelling, grandiose IMAX pictures, an ear-shattering soundtrack, and no obvious weaknesses. The storylines, the pilot drama in black and white, the historical creation of the bomb, the Security clearance Hearing and the flashbacks from Oppenheimer's life go hand in hand and support each other well. The movie does a great job of laying the complexity of the ethical debate around the creation of the bomb and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, without taking sides. However don't be surprised if the movie leaves you without the pure area of an Inception, Interstellar, or TeneT. Less questions are left open and more depressing topics are explored. Overall definitely worth the money and time."
"Up until Dunkirk, I loved Nolan's films. I saw Interstellar 3 times in the theater. The Dark Knight trilogy may be my favorite in the superhero genre. I had high expectations going into Oppenheimer. Sadly, I was falling asleep and checking my phone by the end of the first hour. So boring. The only thing in this film maybe worth watching only when it's available at home were the performances. Murphy and Damon mostly.Idk, I feel like all these people calling it a masterpiece are saying they like this movie because that's what they've been told to think. I don't see how anyone could've walked out of this film entertained in any sense of the word. I wanted to walk out an hour before it was over, which I can only remember doing a couple times in my life. The only reason I stayed was because my nephew wanted to see the end and I didn't want to ruin the experience for him. Thoroughly disappointed."
"No one can doubt Nolan for sure, this is the best movie in the past 5 and after all of his great career and fantastic movies he had it is so beautiful to see that Christopher Nolan still has passion for making movies.The sounds effects the bomb scene it will stay in my mind forever what an experience I lived at that scene, for the first time ever all people in the theater were in silent, people missed these kind of movies.The movie was 3 hours long, somehow you feel there are. Alot of unnecessary scenes and also there are a lot scene should be longer to explain to us more.At the end I truly recommend watching this movie to see the history of the most awful and important invention the human ever made."
"This movie is undoubtedly the best movie I've ever watched, I can't describe to anyone the state of shock I am in by how good the movie was. This movie was not only an experience. But an artistic masterpiece, I felt immersed in the movie completely feeling every emotion all of the people in the movie felt. The acting was fenomenal. I really don't know how I'm going to be able to watch any other piece of cinema without comparing it to Oppenheimer. Lately movies haven't been doing it for me lately I feel like the directors are always trying to push something down our throats and feel cheaply made, this movie is different we are truly lucky to be alive during Cristopher Nolans reign. I think he will go down as the best director of all time if he keeps quality of movies up."
"In ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan presents a remarkable cinematic achievement that explores the significant historical period of World War II and the development of the atomic bomb. With his exceptional vision and storytelling skills, Nolan takes the audience on an immersive journey, vividly portraying the complexities and ethical dilemmas faced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, expertly portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy. The film's meticulous attention to historical accuracy and its stunning recreation of the era are truly awe-inspiring. Nolan's direction captivates viewers, creating a palpable sense of tension and urgency that keeps them on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. The utilization of practical effects and breathtaking visuals enhances the realism, effectively transporting the audience back in time. Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is truly remarkable, as he skillfully captures the scientist's internal struggle between loyalty to his country and the moral implications of his work."
"What can I say, its a piece of art no doubt about it. Picture, sound, colors, actors line up, all of it makes an excellent movie. But what you would find your yourself is that after the movie your brain is gonna go crazy. Crazy because the topic, the execution and sequence of how Nolan presented what was a real life event and the consequences of it that we inherited today is gonna make you think a lot. I can easily say that many movies can be excellent, but only few can be exceptional and Oppenheimer is one of them. Watch it on cinema IMAX, and please do leave some time to think about the last words of that movie, maybe after all art can change the world through each one of us."
"Nolan's MASTERPIECE To The World.I saw it today from the starting to the end it's amazing..it's mind blowing performance..The Casting is the perfect casting I ever seen.. Cillian Murphy & RDJ Was Amazing like more than ever. Every Character was played perfectly..
The Movie Is Real, Massive & Powerful.. Its not just a movie it's the history of mankind..It's a Must Watch Movie of the Century.. I'll See it Again..to find if there anything I missed.. Thanks To Christopher Nolan For Making Such A Masterpiece. He Deserves A Oscar for this also Cillian and RDJ.. I'm Pretty Sure they will..Once Again Guys Just Watch it On IMAX if possible if not Watch it in 4k with Dolby Atoms."
"The cast of the movie is insane every single star deserve an award for his performance. Biographical more than pure drama but Murphy played it very well. I enjoyed it although it is very long. RDJ, Matt Demon and Emily Blunt were all amazing in their characters. I was expecting more ww2 scenes especially the bombing moments but it was not there.Overall the movie is excellent but was overhyped and marketed very well that made a lot of people think it was about the ww2 and involving more war scenes some was disappointed later and see the movie as boring long biography one. Thank you Mr. Nolan."
"It is a masterpiece in this manner:
It plays over several years - and in multiple timelines (it's a Nolan of course it does)It also plays at multiple locations over those several years and not ONCE was it felt necessary to show a time or location stamp on screen and it worked brilliantly, I don't believe anyone would mix up the timelines or locations or don't feel like they know where or when they are as an audienceWhat do I mean by this? Well you know - oh now we are at this location"" without the movie telling you Washington - It also isn't the case with - how much time has passed? - no there are optical clues - others than simply aging the characters, more subtle and not forced."
"It was truly incredible! I strongly encourage you to go to the cinema to see it. It's a rare and unique experience, in line with Christopher Nolan's talent, that you won't forget anytime soon. It's clearly one of his best films, and in many aspects, his finest work. I found the editing work to be amazing, and I really hope it will be nominated for the Oscars for that. The casting is fabulous, the direction is grandiose, Cillian Murphy is superb, and the music and sound design are outstanding. All the images illustrating the quantum world are magnificently illustrated by a sound design that will give you chills. The Trinity sequence puts you in a crazy tension. I can't wait to see it again to fully grasp all its aspects, and the ending leaves you speechless."
"Another christopher nolan masterpiece , presenting the story in such a magnificent way to deliver one of the most touching , extremely involving and thrilling experience , the casting is was perfect and the movie was shot in a really captivating manor , just like a typical Nolan film , cillian murphy was outstanding, realistic and emotionally involved , robert downey JR is the perfect cast for lewis straus , RDJ is just phenomenal and the fact that he wasted 13 years in marvel movies is nothing short of sad , but let's hope thet we are getting some quality performances from RDJ just like lewis straus in the upcoming year."
"I'm a physicist and I watched this movie in IMAX (which made a slight difference) after doing my homework. I saw exactly what I expected which was unusual in itself for a Nolan's film. The movie is set at a period when philosophy mattered as much as physics for a scientist. The movie is all about one person who sees the world around him differently. This visionary genius is now under the terrible predicament of finding the most horrible weapon for the greater good which also happens to be his passion, nuclear fission. The same predicament which Krishna put himself under to instigate destruction. Sadly, he is also put on trial for his exact achievement later. So, He has to bare the cross and get crucified for it! Cillian Murphy recreated Oppenheimer like a magician. The tempo of the movie along with its wave-natured background score using it to pump your adrenaline at key moments. Unfortunately, it got to me in the last 30 minutes at which point I felt the movie is starting to get uninteresting. Overall, a must watch for Cillian Murphy."
"This movie was brilliant all around. The director, the actors, the story, and the soundtrack. For individuals that want a mindless fluff piece - this is not the movie for them.This movie focus on a brilliant mind, history, patriotism, and the truth about politics. Also, it shows the humanity, brilliance and fear in making a bomb of mass destruction. It also reveals how a simple narrative/lie can change the trajectory of someone's life and career.Nolan nailed it and Cillian was brilliant. All Americans should watch this movie. I am still dumbfounded how Barbie is doing better at the box office than this masterpiece."
"The characters felt real and relatable. The movie had a perfect mix of emotions, making me laugh cry, and feel inspired. The cinematography was stunning, and the music added an extra layer of depth to the whole experience. I almost forgot to mention the the insanely talented the extremely good Cillian Murphy. His performance was incredible, and his expressive eyes added so much depth to the character. I was completely drawn into the emotions he portrayed through his eyes, making the movie even more powerful and unforgettable. Cillian Murphy's talent is truly mesmerizing, and it's one of the reasons why I adore this film so much."
"I've been following the filmography of Chris nolan from prestige and he's been a absolute banger when it comes to story telling in a non linear format, on that line oppenheimer hits an another amazing banger in theaters, and he is the only director who can direct a biography in a most exiting way possible and succeeded in it but the only flaw in the movie where i observed in his previous movie after interstellar is that, the audio mixing and sound quality is very poor and recollection of what a character trying to say feels very difficult to grasp, this issues persists for his past movies like Dunkirk and tenet, apart from this i absolutely loved the movie and waiting for his next announcement 👍🏻"
"Watched Oppenheimer. Absolute spectacle fit for watching on a big screen. The whole cast was perfect. Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his career. A shoe in for his first Oscar. Watching RDJ on screen was Cherry on the top, Oscar on the way for him too. Emily Blunt did a fantastic job too.Light travels faster than sound. Mr. Nolan not only made a terrific bomb explosion scene but also he followed the science for the speed of light and sound here. Quite possibly Christopher Nolan's tightest screenplay till date. Top notch BGM, spectacular visuals and Cris Nolan's special nonlinear story telling overall Christopher Nolan dropped an ATOM BOMB."
"Oppenheimer is a movie about the father of the atomic bomb and the war world 2 and how they created the atomic bomb and what is the consequences they got, the first thing I noticed in the movie that you need to know about the world war 2 and the thing that happened that time and i known some people will don't like the movie because it's long but if you like a movie about history and physics this movie is the best for you, the movie was terrifying and I remember my heart was beating so hard and i was very nervous and the best thing that nolan make us feel how the bomb felt when it explode, this movie will be the best movie I've ever seen and experience, this day will be never forgotten in my memory thank you nolan for doing this movie."
"I really like Nolan, he is one of the best! Unfortunately, I fall on media hype and went to cinema with few movie junkies such as myself. Yes I didn't expect entertainment in this genre, but after 30min I literally waited movie to finish. It is super difficult to follow, boring and annoying conversations.. Mat Damon was a joke together with Einstein 😂😂😂😂 and Josh H. I do not know what to say..
I really excited something more interesting and all I got this boring never ending movie.. I would agree with some random comment: this movie is like you are watching movie trailers.. never ending movie trailer 😂😂😂
I was actually laughing on some super serious moments.. that can only say how I lost connection with the characters and plotMaybe, if you like weird stuff like Tenet you will like this Openhimer as well
I am giving this movie 2 / 10 just because I stayed until the end, but first thing on my mind was: I just wasted 3h of my life."
"After a second rewatch in theaters I believe without a doubt Oppenheimer is peak cinema. It is truly an absolutely astonishing film. This is arguably Christopher Nolan's greatest film (probably my favorite after a second watch). Every aspect of the film is just stunning. The acting, writing, pace, etc is so well done and works perfectly for how the film unfolds. The way each character develops and comes into their own and has their moment is truly amazing. Cillian Murphy delivered one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. He deserves to be claimed as one of the best actors of our time, and he deserves his flowers for this performance. With that being said I was truly blown away by Robert Downey Jr performance as Lewis Strauss. He is absolutely remarkable in this role and knocks it out of the park. I can keep going on but I highly recommend any film lover to watch this film ASAP while it is still in theaters. 10/10."
"First, this is a visually stunning movie. I heard an interview where Nolan said going to the movies should be a visual experience first..he delivers. The bigger the screen the better. Sound, effects, and story are great but like all sound these days, the score tends to overpower the dialogue. Nolan's characteristic nonlinear story telling is ever present. If you hate flashbacks and jumps in time, you have to suck it up. The tension between Oppy and Teller over the ""h-bomb"" is a great sub-plot. Dr Lawrence of ""Lawrence-Livermore"" labs is seen more in this film than in other versions of the Manhattan project. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey will earn nominations for their performances when award season rolls around."
"The movie was okay maybe decent. Are we really going to pretend that we were all at the edge of seats the whole time? I feel like the only people who are honestly rating this a 10 haven't ever pondered on their own the true implications of nuclear weapons and MAD. There was Nothing thought provoking about it. It was long and mostly boring. There's no reason not to wait and see it from home... Unless you want to see an 8 person meeting room on the big screen for an hour and half that is.The acting was of course quite good and deserves to be recognized. I think that RDJ stood out for his part. Honestly this may be the weakest Cillian Murphy role I've seen in the last 10 years. But I think that it's part of the problem. If Oppenheimer was an interesting man, the film failed to show me why."
"This movie has a great staff of actors who all did a great job, especially Emily Blunt who really shows her chops in her limited role in the film. The sets of the period where very accurately represented it made you feel like you were in the 1940's, the cinematography was excellent. All of this should make for a great film.Unfortunately, the movie is full of video and sound gimmicks and doesn't deliver on the true story due to extreme political overtones. After 3 hours of viewing, I'm thinking what did I get from this movie? Pretty much nothing, it truly was a bomb!So why is this movie so popular?"
"Watched Oppenheimer in imax, packed cinema. Let me tell you something: when a movie makes you feel certain emotions and forget that you're in a movie then you know that the director did his best. Nolan said: If you don't understand my movie try to feel it, oh boy have I felt it the whole 3hours and 9 seconds of it, and it went so quick I was ready for more. I was worried, scared, laughed, felt anxious and angry. Went through a lot in those 3 hours. Now that was quite the experience. And that's the point of it I guess, that's exactly what I wanted. My opinion is that this film is a masterpiece.."
"I mean just a masterpiece christerfer Nolan did it again. The camera the acting, it made me want to learn more. Robert Downey jr and Matt Damon amazing. I can't forget about cilian Murphy wonderful acting.It is beutiful film that has no mistakes, Emily blunt did great, can't wait for the next Christopher Nolan movie probably better. But it is hard to beat this one, Oppenheimer is a great character. You feel like your there in his place.This would also be a great book, there probably is one, what a movie and I would really want to rewatch when it comes out on Apple t,, must watch beutiful film, have a great time."
"I don't usually take the time to talk about movies I enjoy but man did I enjoy this. Everything from the no use of CGI and the effects instead made you just think ""wow"". Not to mention Cillian Murphys performance is incredible. It really keeps you glued to the screen at all time between the cutscenes and the constant new acts each making you wonder what comes next.Something that made me more amazed than anything is how this movie captures the true horror of the Atomic Bomb. Each scene progresses through the movie and show how it has made and impact on history all by this man.Lastly the end... wow. It was simply an amazing touch to an amazing movie."
"Knowing Nolan's skills, I expected an excellent film firmly grounded in history. Unfortunately, this film watches like a transcript of conversations on Teams. It's boring, overdone and chaotic. The timelines intertwine so that you can't figure out what times you are watching. We watch characters talk to each other and discuss what others have said. Oppenheimer himself has been made into a slightly crazy type who basically doesn't know why he is working on the atomic bomb. I still don't know what his motivation was, it was so hard to tell from the acting. Well, that's right, the acting. With so many excellent actors, Nolan gives us such flat and poorly drawn characters. Oppenheimer's wives, in particular, look like characters artificially glued to the plot. They might as well not have been there and the film would have lost nothing and gained nothing. Unfortunately, I will not recommend this film. It is probably the worst Nolan film I have seen."
"Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that delves into the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist often referred to as ""the father of the atomic bomb."" This haunting and thought-provoking film masterfully captures a pivotal shift in human consciousness over the course of three gripping hours. As a drama that explores the themes of genius, hubris, and the consequences of individual and collective errors, it immerses viewers in the turbulent journey of Oppenheimer, whose research and development of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki forever changed the world."
My fingers can't describe what I saw I saw a masterpiece in opinion no movie will be as this I witnessed history today thank you Mr nolan for this masterpiece thank you for what you created let's come now to cllian murphy if this guy doesn't win the Oscar this is robbery ladies and gentlemen the plot the story the cinematography everything was perfect you need to watch it in imax please don't watch it in a regular screen. I am not Watching any movie after this because none can be better than this another thing Barbie will not even get that close to be good as Oppenheimer. Believe me you will get goosebumps after watching this masterpiece take a break for 10 minutes and let your brain reboot.
"Like most of the Nolan's movies, this movie is fast paced . The non-linear storytelling, the detailed character arcs, and the non-stop dialogues keep you invested, in what would otherwise have been a dull biopic. While the non-stop dialogues , back and forth, keeps you engrossed, it becomes tiring at times and leaves you wanting a break. Performance wise, Robert Downey Jr. Stands out. All other actors have done good job. Music is atmospheric and blends well with the scenes, except for a few instances where it gets too loud and annoying. Nolan should make more movies which are character-driven like Oppenheimer and The Prestige, instead of making sci-fi garbage like Interstellar which had no soul."
"Is this the best movie ever made? Probably not. However, if this is not what the 10 button is used for, I don't know what is. It's a masterpiece. A love for cinema wrapped in a complex drama with acting that is superb throughout. From a technical aspect alone - cinematography, casting, acting, etc. - this deserves every star. Add in the complex flutter of emotions, the tact that Nolan applies throughout the entire story, and the layers of meaning that discuss a whole host of human endeavors and moral scruples, this move becomes what movies are all about. Hollywood should take note - we love THESE movies. Fund THESE movies."
"This is the best movie of I've ever seen. Beautiful score, superb performances, a masterful piece of cinematic art. I was worried about a three hour movie but not a second was wasted. There was nothing self-indulgent and nothing over-wrought. There were blessedly no modern political lessons. It was historically portrayed. OMG Emily Blunt had me wanting to jump from my seat in awe and admiration of her character. RDJ was brilliant and the evolution of his character something amazing to witness. We see the naïveté of brilliant scientists, the depravity of politicians, the heart wrenching reality of not being able to put the atomic bomb genie back in the bottle. Do not miss seeing this movie in the theater. Find the biggest screen with the best sound system. It's worth it."
"This movie was amazing with the cinematography, the acting , and the music was phenomenal, I just think the movie was a little too long and could have been made maybe 20 minutes shorter and the movie was kind of confusing , I didn't understand a lot of it and I had to ask my friend to explain, but it had some of the best cinematography and music I've ever seen , definitely the best sounds and music I've seen in a movie , Cillian murphys acting was amazing as well as Matt Damon and Robert Downey junior . The movie did not disappoint it exceeded all expectations, even though it was 3 hours , I wasn't bored for any it. It hooks you in with the sudden tone changes . I think the movie needs a rewatch to understand the movie better . I'll leave the rating at a 9 but it could become better or worse with rewatch ."
"If you're looking for major explosions and an action packed film, this is NOT it. This is practical effects, amazing dialogue and good view on Oppenheimer and his life and the history of the atom bomb and the moral quagmire on the impact on humanity because of it. Thought provoking and the realization that you can be the smartest man In the room but you have people who want to discredit that. Only reason for not giving it at 10/10 is because the run time. You can feel it towards the end. The run time is worth it however to make sure that you get the entirety of Oppenheimer's life from the start and post WW2."
"A movie that just absolutely captures the importance of profound scientific and global affairs in a spectacular way. It was would be like if Kanye West's ""Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" album was a movie. Cillian Murphy puts on a virtuoso performance encapsulating the deeply complicated and contradictory life that Oppenheimer lived. The pace that the movie runs at is so intense and the music is used perfectly to capture that. The explosion of the bomb is so realistically filmed that you feel fully immersed in Los Alamos. The subtle themes of ""The Fission"" and ""The""fusion"" floated at the beginning of the movie is an incredible way to depict to the two separate courtroom like battles Oppenheimer and Strauss are involved in. Nolan has many great movies under his belt but this movie tops them all."
What a blast of a movie! The choice of actors and characters was staggeringly brilliant. The whole plot and the presentation was almost perfect. The confusing part for me was how the bomb test did not reveal any ripple effects days after for people that were clearly at the site of the test and yet 31 days later the Japanese had long standing side effects. The theater and the music was beautiful.Christopher Nolan did a good job. Robert Downy JR was my favorite and yes I am also generally a big fan of Rami Malek. Overall it's one of those rare movies I give a ten out of ten for the acting and the picture.
"This film runs for a total of 3 hours and is at full throttle from the first minute. Christopher Nolan proves with this movie he is one of the greatest directors of all time. The reason I say that is because this movie is the most non traditional ""Nolan"" movie to date. That doesnt mean its lacking Massive and Beautiful story telling. (Let alone Cillian Murphy's 12/10 performance) The movie is a masterpiece. At times it didnt land with me, and thats ok. I think that is the point. You are not supposed to like it, and that is what makes it real. Without a major plot twist/mind bend per Nolan standard. This movie has left me thinking more than any previous entry in his Catalogue. I am here for every bit of it."
"I was privileged enough to watch this film in 70mm IMAX in Nashville today. I drove about 3 hours each way, and it was absolutely worth the experience. I won't reveal any details about the movie, but I had a visceral, physiological reaction at multiple points during this film. My stomach was in knots, I began to feel very hot to the point that I was sweating. My arms tingled, similarly to the way they do when I am under a lot of pressure. It almost felt as though I was going to break out in hives. I cannot exactly claim that this experience was pleasant, but my body's reaction to this film experience was overwhelming. I could not help but to cry. This movie was incredibly moving in a way that I had never experienced before in a movie theatre. This film is very special."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a cinematic tour de force that left me spellbound, evoking a mixture of thrill and horror as I witnessed the harrowing test of the atomic bomb on screen not once, but twice! This film is an unparalleled masterpiece that delves into the human psyche and the moral complexities of scientific progress, leaving an indelible mark on its audience. Seeing Oppenheimer twice allowed me to appreciate the depth and subtlety of Nolan's storytelling even more. The intricacies of the characters and their relationships become more apparent with each viewing, adding layers of nuance to an already captivating narrative. This film's ability to resonate on multiple levels is a testament to its brilliance and rewatchability."
"Oppenheimer is an incredible film. It was like watching an adapted Thomas Pynchon novel mixed with lectures by favorite physics professors augmented by the inward struggle of secondary characters poised with difficult intrapersonal decisions (except the events in the film actually happened in real life).I sincerely hope Oppenheimer sweeps the Oscars/Academy Awards because everyone involved in the production deserves it. Oppenheimer contains phenomenal performances, remarkable dialogue, flawless writing and production.From a strictly objective point of view, it is Nolan's best film.Rating: 10/10."
"I would say it s the best film seen in a while, but i didn t watch too many. I went it without seeing any trailer reviews and so on, and just bcs cillian is playing and that is a good film. I am a student and never really liked history stuff and wars and for sure i struggled a bit wtaching but it all connected . Stayed with wikipedia opened at some parts and oh wow "" it all makes sense"". I wouldn t say it is too long and for me the last third of the film was the most entertaining one. Before the bomb is just a story after the bomb is the real stuff. And i left that cinema room amazed of what i just watched . The actors were impeccable and the scened as well, dark mysterious good effects. I wish i has seen it imax but i dont have it in my town. All in all it is worth seeing."
"The movie is good but all that noise about seeing it on the biggest screen possible (I did) is unfounded. It's a procedural and you can see it on any screen you want. I was more impressed with the sound than the visuals. FX are secondary and spare, while the framing of individual shots is rather standard and the cuts so quick as too make it practically inconsequential anyway. It's still worth seeing in a movie theater, and it is a good film with some stellar performances. It's almost a shame there are so many name actors in it because it snaps you out of the story when you keep recognizing people in what amounts mostly to bit parts. It's not Nolan's best but it is a decent drama."
"If the film gets you it will leave a deep impact which is hard to recover. I watched the morning show and for the next two days I can't think of anything else and that is the power of cinema. As Scorsese said superhero movies are not cinema and I agree and if you want to know what is cinema then watch this masterpiece. It is Nolan's most subtle and poingnant work may be his best I don't know. The film doesn't rely on heavy breathing spectacle like Nolan's previous works,it is pure drama and everyone must watch it in the biggest possible screen. For cinephiles this film will be a gift but for a one who are into superhero stuffs they should atleast give it a try experience something special."
"""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the accolades it receives. With its captivating storytelling, brilliant direction, and impeccable performances, this movie takes us on an immersive journey into the life and mind of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The film skillfully delves into the complexities of his character, exploring his genius, conflicts, and moral dilemmas. The attention to historical accuracy and the meticulous recreation of the era adds authenticity to the overall experience. ""Oppenheimer"" successfully blends science, history, and human emotions, leaving audiences both educated and deeply moved. It's a thought-provoking and powerful cinematic achievement that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll. A definite 10 out of 10."
"It is my first time watching a biography. I dont usually like to watch such a full of dialogs on a movie, but this was different. I know Nolan's movies like The Dark Knight, Interstellar etc is outstanding, but i dont really expect anything for this movie (Because its not made actually for my taste). Nolan actually did a great job since this is a 3 Hours long movie about Father of the atomic bomb. I really like the transition between Oppenheimer POV and the Strauss one. The plot here is very acceptable and interesting from the beginning. I thought it would be a boring movie because of the dialogs, but it's not. The visualization for the atomic bomb itself is such a tremendous thing. Cillian Murphy has done it again here."
"When I went to watch the movie, i knew it was gonna blow my mind. After all it's directed by Christopher goddamn Nolan. And the movie did just that. The best part about the movie is it's cinematography and sound fx. Nolan poured his heart into the movie as he usually does for any other movie. The way the story was told was very Nolan like and that is the signature of the movie. And the actors!! Cillian is exceptionally brilliant in this movie. He projected his emotions, Oppenheimer's emotions brilliantly. I would also like to mention RDJ and Emily blunt's performance which was goddamn perfect!"
"""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist and leader of the Manhattan Project. The film skillfully weaves together historical accuracy with captivating storytelling, offering viewers a deep insight into the complexities of his character and the moral dilemmas faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. With outstanding performances and breathtaking cinematography, ""Oppenheimer"" keeps audiences engaged from start to finish. A must-watch for history enthusiasts and anyone seeking a thought-provoking cinematic experience."
"Had fun watching the movie. It was worth the 3 hours time especially in the cinema. The storytelling skills of Christopher Nolan are incomparable and really you can see them through the movie. At first you get confused why you don't understand, what that happens and that and then the story keep slowly unfolding while also building tension with the viewer as well. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the movie in imax cinema, because we don't have true Imax in Germany, but nonetheless, it was very enjoyable experience and was worth every minute. I would definitely recommend watching the movie if you haven't already."
"This story needed to be told to the world, and this delivery was perfect. I'm still unpacking it in my head. Was Oppenheimer a villain or a hero? I hated him, was proud of him, happy for him, mad, crushed, elated, and many other emotions. His work changed the world and directly led to our current reality. The human element of progress often comes at a price, and those responsible must live with the results both good and bad.This movie immediately goes into my personal Top 5. The acting, effects, sounds, visual presentation, storyline ... Everything about this movie was spectacular. I was completely riveted. My two, young adult sons watched with me and were likewise impressed."
"Oppenheimer is without a doubt Christopher Nolan's best work ever. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is exceptional and most probably his best work too. The movie is an emotional roller coaster, more political than scientific, and full of great senses (The Nolan Things).The movie should easily win five Oscars. Nolan for best achievement in directing, Robert Downey Jr. Best actor in supporting role, and best achievement in editing. Will mostly be nominated for best picture.9/10, I would have loved to see more of J. Robert Oppenheimer's story outside of the atomic bomb and more on the impact of using it on the world not taking advantage of the technology."
"This movie is simply, amazing. The way everything is shot, is just, immaculate. Sure, some scenes with their nudity don't make much sense, but with how the camera moves during the explosions is stunning. While, admittedly, during the explosions I was trying to silently eat some candy, the way the sound imitates something like a sonic boom with all the vibrations is astonishing of how realistic this is. When seeing this movie's premise, you'd think maybe it just end with the explosions and it's done, but it goes for another hour after that. You really get to see everything, and feel bad for Oppenheimer at the end. While, yes, I did watch Barbie right before this (having quite the mood change) I was still amazed at how good this movie was. Great watch as long as you don't mind the 3 or so minutes of nudity spread across the film and you want to just go ""Wow"" while being on the literal edge of your seat."
"After watching this movie, I couldn't say a word to express how much this movie was AMAZING, every second was meaningful, it was a 3hours movie but I didn't feel that I watched 3 hours I had the feeling that I wanted more !!!It was incredible from the start till the end,
Christopher Nolan did an amazing job,
And the casting was WOWWW
Like all characters were so good played by the actors.They knew who to choose to play oppenheimer, and Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar!!Not only him all the cast of this movie deserve an Oscar for the best movie, and I hope that it will be listed in 250 top movies of all time !!"
"That was the first thing I heard someone in the audience say when the movie ended, and I tend to agree. This film was very densely packed and required all of your attention from start to finish. Also, as someone who was not previously familiar with Oppenheimer's life, I found myself having to be twice as attentive. Of course Cillian Murphy was brilliant as Oppenheimer, his performance is truly what kept me engaged throughout those 3 hours. I really liked the cinematography as well, Nolan did a great job at communicating both the beauty and horror of the atomic bomb. Overall I'd say this isn't a film for the average movie goer, or someone just looking to pass the time on a Friday night. This will require your brain to be flipped on and it will take some time to digest after the fact."
"I used to have respect for Nolan before I realized he doesn't embrace the change of times. It' very simple. You either embrace great changes, grow, and become better or you just become old news trapped in the past. And this is the case with Nolan.While all the great directors like Scorsese, Coppola, Cameron, Kosinski, McQuarrie, etc. Are shooting their great movies in 4-6K resolution digital IMAX cameras and Dolby ATMOS and DTS:X sound, Nolan is still trapped in the past with his stupid analog films and plain DTS-HD MA.And his story telling is just getting worse and worse and more boring. It's all part of the same symptoms of people who are just trapped in the past and can't learn to improve. You just can't teach some old dogs new tricks."
"What could be a three hour yawn turns out to be an explosive combination (pardon the pun) of great story telling and first class performance
Oscar and Bafta winning for film, director and actors alike
You owe it to yourselves to watch this movie it's history and although uncomfortable it show you how once again it's politics that can turn anyone from a hero to a villain - yet they are the true villains - Murphy is compelling Downey Junior shows how to shake off his Tony Stark hero and play a real swine
Blunt as the aggrieved wife is sublime and spot Gary Oldman, surely the best UK character
Edgy compelling directing from Chris Nolan with a great use of perspective
We really don't know Oppenheimer and now we have a window on his world well worth the wait!"
Nothing much to say. Quite a different taste from Christopher Nolan. Great job by literally everyone in this film. Cillian Murphy as well as RDJ put on a crazy performances. It was a pleasure seeing all these great physicists and how they are connected to each other. People interested in theoretical physics gonna absolutely love this.It was more of a political visualisation. Cinematography was certainly on another level. Hoyte van Hoytema deserves even more recognition. Aside from great acting performances the soundtrack is just insane. It was a great experience and I'll talk about everything later in details.
"Oppenheimer. It's hard for me to describe what I have just seen! Christopher Nolan made the impossible possible. He gave us a unique biography movie with great plot. When it comes to acting, Cillian Murphy gave us the best performance in 2023 so far. His eyes and how they reacted is something extraordinary. Robert downey Jr was magnificent , and all the supporting actors were. Spectacular. What I mostly liked about the movie is that it showed us how human are brutal and dont give a heck about others. The sound mixing was nice even though I miss Hans' Zimmer creativity. Finally Oppenheimer is the best movie in 2023 but not the number movie in Christopher Nolan list."
"Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' is a gripping masterpiece that delves into J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, brilliantly. The film navigates his genius, moral dilemmas, and the making of the atomic bomb. Nolan's direction, creates an engrossing narrative that lingers long after the credits roll. I can clearly say this is a piece of art with its multi-dimensional narrative style and engrossing concept. A thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of scientific advancements and the complexities of human ambition. The film's thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of scientific advancements forces the audience to ponder the moral implications of innovation in warfare and the enduring impact on humanity. As the story unfolds, the weight of Oppenheimer's choices resonates deeply, leaving viewers contemplating the responsibility that comes with knowledge and power.Visually stunning, emotionally resonant - a must-watch."
"This movie is very well done and the actors are top notch. Excellent soundtrack! However, it is rather boring. Like an unnecessarily long, overly complicated, theatrical documentary. Beforehand I was concerned that I might have to go for a toilet break during the THREE HOURS. Turns out I didn't, but I could have gone anytime between minute 30-90 and basically in the whole last hour. Also, Emily Blunt's obvious Botox/fillers really disturbed the experience for me - it made me very aware of the fact that I was watching an actress and not the character. I get the whole ""double punishment"" debate but don't think it has a place in the movie industry without context. It only messes with the absurd beauty standards even more to normalise it."
"Such a captivating film throughout. Theres a lot of information and dialouge to this film but each scene is short and fast paced, like it resembled the pressure and urgency of their task. The short, fast paced scenes keep you interested and on the edge of your seat as the film builds and builds up to the point of the test. My only critism is the explosion itself, although the sound was okay, it didn't feel as dramatic as there were a lot of loud scenes leading up to the explosion so it felt underwhelming in comparison. I also feel that the visuals of the bomb was slightly underwhelming. However, I believe Nolan didn't want to use any CGI for the explosion so considering it was done with real explosives, it was still impressive. Nolan never fails to suprise me with his films. A must watch."
"A masterclass in film making. Nolan has been consistently creating fantastic films for years and 'Oppenheimer' is no exception. Dialogue, cinematography and pacing are all on point. Ludwig's score is a perfect match for the aesthetic of the film. I have no doubt that Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt and ESPECIALLY Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy will all be up for awards, alongside Nolan and the movie itself. A future classic to be sure. As far as historical biopics go, a difficult and perhaps sensitive topic to tackle given its relevance today, but the messages and philosophy's shown through how the narrative is written and how history is represented throughout the movie is something I'm sure people will remember. 9/10."
"Oppenheimer boasts an outstanding performance by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer himself. His portrayal adds depth and authenticity to the character, complementing the film's overall brilliance. Nolan's choice to cast Murphy further elevates this already compelling cinematic experience.Cillian Murphy's extraordinary portrayal of Oppenheimer deserves an Oscar nomination and recognition. His nuanced and captivating performance elevates the character to new heights, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.Leaving the cinema, I felt kinda weird after watching the movie. All thanks to the amazing cinematography and plot."
"An excellent beautiful masterpiece. The steller cast gave all to bring alive one of the most important events of our history. Cillin Murphy, Robert Downey was phenomenal. And not only him, each and every performance were at the top of their game. Nolan provided us with an opportunity to witness history. Three hours went by like it was nothing. Watch it with an audience, and this masterpiece will make you feel something different. In the end, you start to think, the weight of our actions as a human, the lives everything, you start to re-evaluate all.Beautiful, extraordinary. Cinema at its best."
"I had high hopes for this film, but it far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX, because it is visually stunning. On any screen it's still a masterpiece. There were so many stories that could have been told about Oppenheimer, but the way they told the story was so respectful yet captured so many important aspects of his life. With all the controversy, complexity, and mystery that surrounds this story, be it politics, ethics, or science, this film artfully layered it's scenes with a deep understanding, using metaphors and parallels that left me reeling with contemplation. There are so many layers, that this film can be a completely different movie depending upon how much of this story you knew before, yet still leave you dumbfounded by how beautifully these messages are delivered. The cast is nothing short of magnificent. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorites, but this may be his best yet. It's been more than 24 hours, and I'm still mind blown over how good it really was!"
Only Nolan can do this mix. When you talk about the atomic bomb and explain the complex physics of it's manufacturing in a such a simple way you have to be Christopher Nolan. But actually the movie is not about the bomb it's about the era of the world war and specifically the scientists and the conflict they suffered when one of the most revolutionary inventions turns into a lethal weapon that will kill hundreds of thousands or more. With the outstanding performance of cillian murphy as usual and the magnificent cast in every single role. The most surprising was Robert Downey Jr he was on fire the best role in his entire career so far. To sum up it's the perfect movie with the perfect director with the perfect cast with perfect soundtrack.
"I always rush to the cinema to see Christopher Nolans latest films. This is the best and biggest release of the year and it really didn't disappoint. The camera work, the stills all beautiful. Didn't have the luck of seeing it in IMAX because none of the cinemas in my town support it so that was disappointing for myself. Really have to pay careful attention to what is going on, the pacing was constant but tells a great story. The reference to JFK at the end I really appreciated after watching Kevin Costners masterpiece recently. Nolan said that he took inspiration from that film and Lawrence of Arabia, heroine turned to villain and victimised summed up Oppenheimer just like those films. Definitely got my moneys worth today. Go see it!!"
"If you see one film this year, or this decade, let it be Oppenheimer. This is one of the greatest films of all of history. This is a deep film too. I am broke, taking money out of my IRA to pay a bit off of the credit cards in order to see this movie. I needed to see this film opening day in IMAX. I am glad I did. Very important film. It is rated R, but I would still recommend you see this movie with your older children supervised. That is if they are well behaved. This is a movie that you don't take a restroom break halfway during. Go before. Don't buy a large soda and popcorn. I never do anyway. But I sometimes buy a double Jack and Coke at AMC Theatres. But this film I decided not to get a drink. No distractions."
"#Oppenheimer is by riveting film he's ever made. The sheer amount of information and detail is astonishing. It's not going to be his most watchable being that it's 3 hours of drama. This will require multiple viewings to get everything. On the technical side Nolan creates some of the most visual spectacles I've witnessed and he's absolutely going to win an Oscar for sound. Everyone including Florence Pugh and Matt Damon were incredible but Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are going to go heavy on awards night. Also this may very well be Christopher Nolans win. There's some pacing issues as I felt like it at times did feel like 3 hours but there's times where it flew by. This movie is an absolute blast (pun intended).10/10."
"A classic Nolan film! The biggest aspect is the visuals that were made with no cgi, a true masterpiece and the acting was simply impeccable, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Made it much more epic, the sound quality recieved so much hype that, I expected a lot but was disappointed (since, I expected a lot). A history repeated film, all the aspects i.e. Acting, visuals, sound and a special mention to the music team, I never got a single chance to believe, whether or not there was a cgi involved, it was a true visual, I suggest you to watch it twice or thrice if you are not a history and a science brat! But a true masterpiece and a must watch!!!"
""" Oppenheimer "" is a cinematic triumph that deserves all the accolades it receives. It's a rare gem that combines artistic vision, exceptional performances, and thought-provoking storytelling into an unforgettable movie-going experience. If you're a fan of cinema that challenges and inspires, this is a film that you absolutely cannot miss. Prepare to be swept away on a journey of emotions and artistry that will leave you breathless and in awe.The cinematography and visuals are stunning, capturing the beauty of the locations and adding to the overall charm of the film. The director's artistic choices, coupled with a poignant musical score, enhance the emotional impact of key scenes, leaving an indelible impression on the audience."
"3 hours I can't get back. I fed into the hype. The countless news articles and YouTube videos about the movie. And then I watched it...Boy was I disappointed. I should've known better. Oppenheimer is a very boring and tedious film. It requires your FULL attention and I'm not a fan of that. The scenes were way too long and the pacing was slow as a snail. What did I expect? An action film or a thriller? It's a biography about the brilliant mind(s) behind one of the most pivotal moments in world history. Having said that, it doesn't make the movie likable in my opinion. On a positive note the acting and cinematography was great. Everything else was meh."
I saw many movies during my life but not one was for me good enough to write an Imbd review. This movie has everything a good movie must have and even more than that. It is a biopic as great as it could be and mostly even historically correct. But for me a citizen of Eastern Europe it also has an essence of understanding of the great danger that the atomic bomb is. The movie uses no CGI and show real explositions of bombs and it is better than what any CGI could make. It is also very philosophical in its thinking about the threat that the bombs make. But most importantly the actors from the main Cillian Murphy to others like Emily Blunt and Robert Downey jr. Are all just as wonderful as they could be. This movie is a masterpiece and a must-see.
"Other then interstellar and inception, I can genuinely say this is one of his best movies hes made so far. The amount of detail put into the movie was amazing and I love the film/editing effects he did to convey or portray a setting or time or place. It was a long movie, 180 minutes of runtime but honestly when it was over I turned to the person I was with and told them I wanted to see it again and they said the same thing. Also we couldn't help whisper to each other at parts because sometimes i can be a little tough to follow with all the historical figures. Would recommended everyone go and see it to see the dilemma he lived with. He did the right thing but he also created a much dangerous world."
"Oppenheimer is something very unique when compared to a conventional movie. It is a moving experience which captivates the events of the Manhattan Project as well as the life of Robert Oppenheimer. The musical score tied in with the dialogue and storyline takes the audience on a journey through a prominent piece of history. From the time in which the movie started to it's ending, there was not one scene that drew you away from the action of what has taken place. Nolan's creative style has effectively been portrayed in this movie. Definitely worth watching in a cinema to get the full experience of what this masterpiece has to offer. This movie may not be for everyone, but is something that everyone should see in their lifetime."
"It's perfect in every aspect, the greatest Nolan masterpiece to date and contender for best film of all time. Genuinely that good. Don't be surprised if they walk out with most awards for film in the next year!Cast, acting, script, pacing, cinematography, staging, effects, audio, score, everything - just perfection all around. Not to mention the historical accuracy and attention to detail. See it on the biggest screen you can manage as well, seriously worth the extra shrapnel for what it does for the experience.Nolan can't keep getting away with this. Seriously one of the best pieces of visual media I have ever seen (I know am young but I watch a lot of classics)."
"I just saw it on IMAX 70mm, I would say I have seen lots of movies in my life till now but Oppenheimer is the first FILM I have ever seen. Must be watched on IMAX 70mm (that is the way Nolan and his team made it), if that is possible (because only 30 theaters in entire world are capable to show this movie in Imax 70mm) and you do so I promise you will experience something very special that you never did and you will never forget.Its a masterpiece if I want describe it in one word, everyone's act also is super great but what Cillian Murphy did is in another level, music is also great, sounds are perfect, can't wait to watch it again."
"I think this was my best experience in the cinema in a very long time. I had the chance of watching it on 70mm and it was really staggering. I admire the team for making such a film about one of the most sensitive and important stories to be told. As a filmmaker myself; i know how exciting it is to make a film about true events and i know this are the hardest stories to tell. Moreover, the background score was beautifully done, it really achieved the emotional impact it was intended to put upon the audience, great score. I didn't expect nudity in a Nolan film,but i understand it was necessary to tell the story in a more sophisticated and realistic way.This is a film i'm considering 10/10 in a first watch.I recommend the viewer to watch this Great Motion Picture."
"A compelling, eye opening story. As well as incredibly visually appealing in its 70mm glory, for a movie that was majority talking there was never a dull moment. The actors were fantastic. Cillians eyes showed everything and portrayed emotions the real J Robert Oppenheimer showed in real footage phenomenally. The movie felt like a thriller and had me on the edge of my seat in some scenes. The score was also incredible and presented so many emotions that's created moods and tension throughout the film. For the first time in a while I left the theatre speechless and moved and this movie really got me thinking. Once again Christopher Nolan has created a terrific film."
"The movie had beautiful shots throughout the movie as well as mini storylines that kept you well entertained Even up to the three hour mark. With all the movie shorter than ever It is good to see a film that can entertain people for hours on end. The storyline that was presented in this movie was incredible and well worth every second. The soundtrack was breathtaking and amazing to see in theaters. The storytelling aspect of the movie was able to capture you the entire way. The bomb seen was beautifully done and away, not seen before in explosions. I truly great film that explores the history of the atomic bomb."
"Best movie of recent times. It's good because it tells a very important character in history but best explained. I've watched a lot of Bibliographies but this one would be really hard, the best Bibliography ever. Especially the Atomic bomb scene impressed me, I froze on the stage and I really loved the scene. I'm sad I didn't have the opportunity to watch imax but it was awesome even in classic form. If you like science fiction, If WW2 interests you and if you're wondering what is the death that destroys of the worlds. Definitely don't miss this 3-hour bibliography of Oppenheimer, the father of the Atomic Bomb."
"Another masterpiece from the master himself, Christopher Nolan.Fascinating movie, cast, and production.With its everyone-and-the-kitchen-sink casting, alternating between color and black and white, fit-for-Imax spectacle and Ludwig Göransson's pounding musical score, Oppenheimer seeks to overwhelm the audience, an approach that works to an extent.The gorgeous visuals by DP Hoyte van Hoytema, the impeccable sound design by Richard King and the impressive editing by Jennifer Lame come together to create something stirringly grandiose yet delicately intimate.Definitely the movie of the year."
I am waiting for this movie in 2 years and I watched it my experience is all time greatest movie ever when I watching movies and series for enjoy but you are not enjoying this movie it is a imotion for you I am pretty sure that is a Oscar winning movie. If I am director of this movie it is my greatest time to me I am proud of me but it is a one of greatest director of history Christopher Nolan movie he is a legend of unexpected and mind-blowing movie I am pretty sure all Christopher Nolan odians are watching the movie and I am saying for odians if you watch this movie you are legend thank you.
"Oppenheimer is a film that will stay with you long after you've seen it. It is a powerful and moving story about the creation of the atomic bomb and the man who created it. The film is visually stunning, with a stunning recreation of the atomic bomb test and emotionally powerful, with a deeply moving portrayal of Oppenheimer's inner turmoil.The film is sure to spark important conversations about the nature of war, power, and the human cost of technological advancement. It is a film that will make you think long and hard about the implications of our scientific progress.A must watch for Science and History enthusiasts."
"This was a tough one because I would consider myself a film nerd. I have been for 20+ years. So, was this film a high level of filmmaking? Yes. Was the acting in this film top notch. Yes! Was the writing, costume, set design, editing all good? Yes. I don't mind movies that are dialogue heavy. This was definitely that type. I had trouble giving this an 8, but I figured it did mostly everything great...however, just didn't captivate me like I was expecting. If I'm being honest, it felt like a 7.6 or so. Which I consider really good.The story kind of dragged on a little longer than I felt it needed. It wasn't particularly entertaining (Even though I like historical pieces and this subject matter) I just didn't get into it as much as I thought. It's like it's missing something and I haven't put my finger on it. Kind of reminds me of how I felt after the J. Edgar Hoover film.Anyways, it's worth a watch."
"OMG..! It Took Just 57 Days And Zero VFX For Christopher Nolan To Create Another Masterpiece This Time... The Characters, The Plot, The Storyline OMG! I Just Can't Express It.. But Will Say I'm Glad That I'm Still Alive In Nolan's Era Of Making Masterpieces..! After TENET I Was Desperately Waiting For Nolan's Another Masterpiece And On July 21 My Gosh He Delivered It With OPPENHEIMER! I Usually Say To The People That To Understand Nolan's Masterpiece You Have To Watch It At least Two Times.. That's Not Complain That's The Compliment Of Nolan's Artwork..! Moreover The Cast Was Iconic.. Will Just Say Go And Watch It..!#Oppenheimer💥"
"One of the best movies i have ever seen. The music, cinematography, cast and story are marvelous. Cilian Murphy outdid himself with this one. Christopher Nolan shows once again why he is one of the best directors Out there. A story like oppenheimers is one that deserves a movie of this quality. Every actor played their role superbly, which you could expect from such a cast. Every scene was important, noteworthy and felt like you had to watch it. Not a single unnessecary moment, joke or character that was added for the storyline, the story itself was amazing enough. I dont know how they did it, but this might be one of the best movies of all time. Wow."
"I'm still trying to digest what this film was, I was paralyzed for 5 minutes as the credits rolled. I can barely describe the contribution to the history of cinema that Christopher Nolan has just made.Cillian Murphy was truly magnificent in his role as J. Oppenheimer, the photography so powerful, every detail, every sound. A splendid work that only Nolan could have done with such tenderness, cinema is not dead! It's been years since I was so enchanted by a production, honestly, I could watch this film in the cinema over and over again.I would like to say a thousand things, but I just can't, guys... just watch this masterpiece!"
"I was expecting more coverage of the physics and leadership of Dr O. Instead Nolan seems singularly focused on setting the record straight on Oppenheimer. A great cast but the constant switch back and forth to scenes from the past plus conversations drowned by background music, and a focus on the conspiracies surrounding Oppenheimer, got a bit tiring. I expected a different movie. One that used imax to its maximum. I could've just watched this at home, with subtitles to aid my comprehension of otherwise hard-to-hear dialog.This movie was over-hyped. It is okay for a director to interpret rather than illustrate since it's not a documentary, but that cannot be at the expense of telling the full story. I will be wary of watching new movies from Nolan going forward. Your mileage might vary, but I am not a fan."
"An incredible movie a one from his kind actually, the cast is incredible and I want to prise Robert Downey Jr. I saw a lot of people talks about Cillian Murphy I agree that his performance is great but Robert it's from another world I think he will get an Oscar for his performance.And finally mr Christopher Nolan will get an Oscar he gave us a movie that we will never forget look at the cast look at the story look at the Dialogue It's a 10/10 movie of course
And the sound effects oh man it's extraordinary I recommend you to watch the movie in imax screen and you will see what I am talking about."
"Chris making a movie where Cillian is playing the leading role is something I never knew I needed. I rated this movie 10/10 even though there were things in dialogs I didn't quite catch up with or understand but just as Chris says for his films: Don't try to understand them, feel them and boy did I feel this one because my head was spinning afterwards. Though I am sure I will understand everything after a rewatch. Great movie, the cinematography was beautiful. Scenes where they zoom in Cillian's face and where we kinda see what was Oppenheimer thinking or feeling in some moments seriously made me terrified in a good way. We definitely need Cillian in more main roles in movies with a good director like Nolan and a good plot because this man deserves it. I watched many Nolan's movies and they never disappoint and this one just adds to the list. Give this man an Oscar already which he definitely doesn't need but deserves."
"A very important movie because it tells the most important story in the history of mankind, which is the story of the nuclear bomb, but it does not tell the story of the bomb, but rather the one who invented this bomb, who is Robert Oppenheimer, who played the role of Cillian Murphy, who gave an Oscar performance And he gave us wonderful psychological acting scenes, and the other actor, Robert Downey Jr., who gave the best performance in his career, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and all the actors performed their roles wonderfully, but the defect of this movie is that it is complicated. In explaining the nuclear bomb and during the talk of the scientists it will make you somewhat distracted and the second negative is that I was waiting for a movie by Nolan such as Interstellar or Inception, but I found myself in front of a biographical movie with the fingerprint of Christopher Nolan But I enjoyed the movie even though I expected more from this movie and it is definitely the best movie of the year so far But it includes some boredom and suffers from the long time in the elephant."
Christopher Nolan's best work till date. Cillian Murphy is phenomenal. Mr. Murphy's performance was breathtaking and exceptional. Him as J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of the best choices ever made in cinema history. Cillian Murphy 's performance is extraordinary in this movie. The screenplay is tremendous and unique. The dialogues in this movie is very powerful. Best writing by Christopher Nolan.the way suspense and thrill was built in this movie i have no words.it is This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time. Each and every actor and actress gave excellent performance. You will feel like you were there and everything is happening infront of your eyes. This is not just a movie it is an experience. There is so much to absorb from this movie. Truly a 10/10 movie. I felt things that i have never felt before while watching this movie. I was emotional moved by this masterpiece. Got goosebumps while watching it. Absolutely loved loved loved this movie. The experience is unforgettable and extraordinary. Glad i did go to watch the movie (2 times)
Completely zero entertainment. There is no story at all. People are flocking theatres with hype created and at the end there is no single person who seems to have enjoyed the film. Some people who tell they liked the film are bluffing acting like intellectuals with reality being they are dumb *ss. Do your self a favor and skip this crap. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie.
"I think this is second or third best movie from Nolan. The non linearity in storytelling is the typical Nolan thing. If you are Nolan fan ,this movie will keep up the hype. And the acting has been exceptional. Cillian really nailed it and so rdj too. The visuals and background score makes it quite good. If you compare it with other Nolan movies you might find this weak but in this genre you can;t do much .Emily Blunt have some strong scenes. Second half is too paced and good. First half is good and slow but you might not get some stuffs if you miss those conversations in first half. I would have given 9.5 but since i m Nolan fan so i am bit biased here."
"Oppenheimer is without a doubt the best movies of the year. Not only is it the best movies of the year but it is one of the greatest movies of all time. This movie is a cinematic masterpiece with breathtaking visuals and sound design. It is a 3 hour rode that flies by very quickly. Bot a single second is wasted, every moment serves a purpose. This movie also has excellent performances throughout especially when it comes to Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy. The side characters are also incredible. Oppenheimer is not only a biopic, it is also a character study that goes deep like the likes of taxi driver. It allows you to explore oppenheimer and his thinking in a very detailed way. Nolan has done it again! 10/10."
"I left the theatre in awe of this film. The story is so compelling and expressed the duality of creating a weapon that can save and destroy masterfully. The performances are sublime, Cillian Murphy will rightfully collect plaudits from everyone for a stunning performance as the titular character but RDJ and notably Emily Blunt deliver some breathtaking performances that I am amazed by.Christopher Nolan shows every bit of his genius when it comes to film making, the cinematography is flawless and he picks his moments with sound and visual effects perfectly. They all serve a purpose contributing to the storytelling and the epic cinematic moments in this film.This film is undoubtedly and unequivocally a must see and a contender for Nolan's best work."
"We have talking, more talking, again talking, then a bomb and then again talking talking talking.Plus confusing time zone mix-ups, women characters who are next to nothing (kind of a trademark of CN),
a soundtrack which is waaaay to much for this kind of biopic, a try to take all of his live into the movie and delivering next to nothing at all, a character study which isn't really one (since you don't know nothing about Oppenheimer by the end and what it did to him on a personal level) and you need to be prepared with his live before the movie otherwise you are missing to much.So in short: Not his best, not the masterpiece everyone wants it to be and the hype suggest. But please go and see it for yourself."
"It's hard to articulate all the thoughts, but y'all remember when we used to be kids and watched Batman and lived the character for a few days? Cillian Murphy had a similar impact on me. Ludwig Göransson's score was perfect and will not let you miss Hans Zimmer. Screenwriting is something Christopher Nolan has mastered since Memento. Can we call Oppenheimer Nolan's best work? I'd say no! But this will be considered a film that is unique from the other films he has made. Can we call it Cillian Murphy's best role? A big yes! Because of the superhero movies, we often forget how great an actor Robert Downey is. As Lewis Strauss, he blew everyone's mind! Magnificent actors, Incredible storytelling and Engaging music. A simple 8/10. The only complaint is the run time. I felt like 15 mins from the court room drama can be trimmed."
"I walked into Oppenheimer expecting something incredible, and that is what I got. Oppenheimer is truly Christopher Nolan at his best in terms of script writing, directing and film making. The score, the cinematography, everything about this film is fantastic. Some may find the 3 hour runtime a bit daunting but it doesn't feel like 3 hours at all! The performances from all the cast are amazing and they make the characters truly believable, but Cillian Murphy shines the brightest as he finally gets the lead role in a Nolan Film. His performance is worthy of an Oscar Nomination if not a win. This film is a 100% go see! Watch it in IMAX, it's an incredible experience. However, if you don't like dialogue driven movies then this might not be for you, but I would still recommend you see this work of art. It is a mature story with some sex scenes but if you're 14, mature 13 I would say it's fine."
"Perfect Movie. All aspects. Political, social, emotional, historical everything is good. Except One scene where Bhagavad Gita quote with romantic shots. Totally disappointed.Another thing is, only theoretical aspects were shown. No single practical aspect or experiment was shown. Which was much needed.About Acting, RDJ, Murphy are exceptional actors. No personal presence of any actor. Movie takes audience bank in time. This movie is milestone and ideal for all other Directors.Unlashing every aspect of Oppenheimer as a person is phenomenal.All other things are fine. And I am waiting for another project of Nolan."
"Absolute banger by Christopher Nolan. It's just not a movie it's a sensation, the point it tries to make about chain reaction is justified by the experience you get from watching the movie. This movie frequently touches upon the fact that now mankind truly has the power to destroy itself. From stunning visuals to real like sound effects, this movie is a masterpiece of this generation.It's a pretty loaded cast with Cillian as the lead it uses his extraordinary skills to make it feel as stunning as it can get. Robert Downey also does a great job showing how good of an actor he still is. I would recommend it to anyone who wants bang for their buck in cinemas."
"The plot of the movie is brilliant. The life of Oppenheimer before, during and after the atonic bomb is spectacular. Oppenheimer having to do with complex things makes the movie more filling. Showing the present and the black and white during it, makes the movie more interesting. Christopher Nolan's best work so far. This is deserved for Oppenheimer knowing how is life worked and how he dealt with things you couldn't imagine you had to deal with. Overall, an excellent movie with very good actors. The acting of Cillian Murphy and how similar he looks to Oppenheimer is illustrious. I would recommend this 3 hour long good movie. It tells a amazing story."
"Amazing movie, loved the film. Cillian Murphy with an oscar deserving performance, everyone did well in the movie. RDJ did so well, loved his role in the film. The music by Ludwig was so so good, the build up for detonation was so good with his music. The detonation was really good, the way Christopher Nolan gave the build up towards the detonation was top notch. This is pure cinema. One of my all time favorite film! In one particular scene, everyone moved to the front of their seats, the heart raced so hard, bet no one ever felt like that while watching a film. I highly recommend this film to everyone!"
"The actors and the acting performance were fascinating i loved cillian murphy in this movie but the sounds effect are an actor in this film too.no boring shots or momment nollan made somthing maybe with Nolan made something that some people could have. It is a boring thing for a beer. Something fun, visual and audio, right on the screen. It is one of the most important events of the well, and it is the making of the atomic bomb that changed the future of mankind. I advise anyone to see the movie in the cinema, you will regret it if you miss it... Because at a time when cinema was boring and people did not listen to cinema, Nolan came up with a movie that revives the spirit of cinema."
This film was incredibly interesting with amazing actors with Cillian Murphy taking main lead of this 3 hour film was incredible since he took kinda a lead in Peaky Blinders I knew Oppenheimer would be a success with him. Also nice sound and visual effects clear and crisp you felt as if your were in the film you felt involved lots of great knowledge especially if your a history nerd or just love a good 3 hour film this one is the one for you so this film is recommended it's a 10 out of 10 for me. Enjoy it with friends or family or even alone it quiet a film good job Christopher Nolan you definitely did well.
"As per usual Nolan delivered a knockout punch with his latest movie Oppemhiemer. Seeing the movie on the day of the release was one of the most impactful moments in my cinema reviewing life. Dynamic and full of contrast, Oppenhimer perfectly captures the rush, fear, and anticipation of the Manhatten Project. The movie is ae easy 9/10 purely for the sake the trailer let the movie on to be more linear. The movies only downside is the constant cuts can sometimes be hard to follow, however, those aspects allow for an abundance of re-watchability. Every actor gave a stellar performance and this movie is something that is both entertaining and educational into the psychological break down Robert Oppenhimer experienced.It is with great pride I can place this movie in my top 20 with a final rating of 9. Go watch this movie on the big screen and except to be blown away."
"The film was great maybe even perfect for the first 2hrs, the last hour was confusing and felt like it moved at a slower pace than the first 2hrs. However the Movie was great no matter the length, great characters and visuals, However the best thing about this was the music, just perfect. The movie Could be Top tier if I wasn't so tired after the movie, Oppenheimer is A great,cinematic, dramatic and visually outstanding Movie, that is only pushed down by its pacing. In all honesty the movie is my Second favourite Nolan film next to the Dark Knight. I will give the Movie a 8/10, worth A watch.Don't worry no spoilers: it might need a second rewatch for me though."
"Even though the film is 3 hours, it seems relatively quick. People who are not very understanding of the political situation over the entire world during the II world war and the importance of what made physicists like Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg etc important are very likely going to find the movie hard to understand. But if you don't come in the category just like me, prepare to have your mind blown. (Pun intended) It's the best ensemble of actors chosen with very conscious casting by Nolan. The ""Can you hear the music"" score is going to give you chills for sure. Everyone were amazing but Cillian, Downey, Damon and Blunt stole the show."
"Why One Piece Is Better Tan Naruto or other anime?One piece is complex and deep, one of the greatest manga ever you can't compare it to naruto, naruto is simple and straightforward, has no depth at all, mainly for children, while one piece has a more dark world, complex and realistic characters, discussing more complex and detailed themes, naruto has forced drama and the most childish philosophy in anime, while one piece was perfect at the philosophy of freedom and slavery, saying that naruto has more mature themes than one piece is a crime, dude, it is all cliche themes , one piece discussed themes like slavery,racism and slavery of the mind in depth,naruto never discussed a theme in depth,even the most special thing which is pain's philosophy was beaten by talk no jutsu, one piece has cannibalism and famine, people commit suicide because of starvation,maybe naruto is sadder."
The best movie from Nolan every day it is very slow no action full lag but we need to know that this movie is about a scientist who first created a atomic bomb so to tell about how Robert Oppenheimer made that atomic bomb and how many difficulties he faced in making it and after making it Nolan did an absolute fantastic way of telling the story amazing plot and this is the main reason it is slow to make sure everyone understands j.robert Oppenheimer story but if it would have amazing dubbing for different countries it would be more successful that is little dissapointing but however Nolan story way of expression and directing way every one can understand his depth of excellence work simply the most greatest movie ever made absolute masterpieceMy rating1000/10.
"If you think this is Nolan's best movie or even ""at the same level"" than his best movies... then you actually don't like Nolan. At all.Yes, this biopic has all the things that make his style, but no matter how complex Nolan tries to make this... in the end it's just a biopic and nothing can ever change that.Good for him if this was intentional, to get into good graces with the critics, maybe even win some awards that he should've won with Prestige, Inception, TDK or Tenet.But this is a (mostly) boring biopic (with two or three 5/10 minutes good sequences and a great 15' ending)... but in 3 freaking hours, and for people that can't and won't accept his big, fun, entertaining movies are also intellectually superior, as they won't ever accept a popular thing can be also smart."
"Oppenheimer was a perfect redemption from Tenet. Murphy performance was masterful. The differentiation between of the black and white and color scenes added tremendous depth to the film. Consciously can say this was the quickest 3 hour movie I have ever watched; no scene felt like it dragged on for too long. There were some quirky dialogue lines throughout the film, but were easily washed out by the sheer beauty of the cinematography and performances by the rest of the characters. Nolan is a known physics lover, which is again evident through this film, but at no point was the viewer ever concerned that they would not understand what was being discussed by the scientists. 10/10. Nolan does it again."
"I went to the movies to see what's the hype is all about. At first I already knew that the movie would be phenomenal because it's directed by Christopher Nolan but my God did the movie exceed my expectations, especially in the cinematography, sound effects, and the direction that the directors had from the movie, and seeing how Cillian Murphy impersonated Robert Oppenheimer in the best way an actor should be. And I had a lot of fun experiencing this movie, especially in IMAX thank you Christopher Nolan for this masterpiece. I know I'm not a movie critic or anything but if you enjoy movies and love the cinemas, I highly recommend Oppenheimer."
"While I regret missing my history class, this movie proved to be an excellent substitute, bringing the history of the Atomic bomb to life with engaging storytelling and powerful performances. It highlighted the complexities and moral dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and the team, making it a thought-provoking experience. As a software engineer, the film reminded me of the significance of innovation and the responsibility that comes with te
In conclusion, the movie based on J. Robert Oppenheimer was a remarkable cinematic journey. It not only satisfied my curiosity about the history of the Atomic bomb but also resonated with my interests in science and technology. The film's meticulous attention to detail and accurate portrayal of historical events made it an educational and emotionally compelling watch. Whether one is a history enthusiast or a technology professional like myself, this movie offers an enriching experience that leaves a lasting impact."
"The acting of the cast was brilliant but it would have been better as a mini series which would have allowed for an exploration of topics that just have been glossed over in the movie. The timeline of events felt rushed, the psychological state of Oppenheimer and his questions about morality just scratched the surface. His relationships to e.g. The women in his life and brother were not further explored. Thus, the portrayal of Oppenheimer is stuck in a weird place between a one and three-dimensional character. A mini series would have added much more depth to an interesting, conflicted man as well as the historical context and events."
"I was so hyped to see this movie especially after the first positive reviews on IMDB. My son and I even used the opportunity on our short trip to Hong Kon to watch it as we live in Shanghai and I am bot sure when it will be released in China.The cast is very good yet the movie is plain boring. I fell asleep twice during the first hour. The constant background music was so annoying. It was only talk and very little about the actual bomb making and design. The bomb testing was just plain bad, lile a low budget movie. The remaining hour of the movie was a court drama. I can't believe people liked this crap. My son was waiting for this movie for a long time and asked me twice to walk out."
"A movie that was undoubtedly amazing and undisputed. We did not feel bored throughout its three enjoyable hours, which was full of many scenes and details as if you were actually living that era in history. The movie was really the pinnacle of cinematic creativity, and is truly considered one of the rare cinematic icons, especially since it was made by the genius director Christopher Nolan, who writes his name in golden letters in history, And let's not forget the rest of the wonderful crew, without exception. I can say that the film deserves to compete for the Oscars this year, if not the best ever."
"Nolan's dialogue is always intriguing, and it is probably the best it ever was in Oppenheimer. However, heavy dialogue films may not be someone's ""Cinematic experience"", and therefore I would advise some individuals to watch the film at home.The film does it's best to make the audience understand at least the basics of what Oppenheimer is working on, however the sound mixing (as usual) sometimes overshadows the conversation, potentially leaving some audience members confused.However I was interested throughout the entire 3 hours, as a lover of cinema, the topic and the historical period, this was a pleasure to watch."
This movie was a master piece ...how well conducted the story line is ..... And sound effects are Just too Awesome to explain ...you will regret missing this movie. This Movie already Have legendary actors but still They performed Thier roles with such Fine acting ...each and every actor showed their every single emotion and They put their heart sweat on this movie and I clearly saw that.... I expected a lot from this movie ..and yeah i.can clearly say... it stands upto my Expectations...WHAT A GREAT MOVIE.... Everyone Should Watch this Master piece ....I am sure you will not regret after watching this movie. THIS MOVIE SURE DESERVES AN OSCAR .. THEY BETTER GIVE THE OSCAR.
"It's a rare relief when a film is released that isn't laced with left wing political messages, and doesn't incorrectly cast white men as either women, black, or both. We need more films with 90% female casts, but we don't need to lie and pretend history is differentThe story is powerful and hits on more levels than you'd expect. The acting is great aside from a few cheesy one liners, all of which seem to have made it into the trailer. I expected a cheese fest like the imitation game, but was subtly surprised to find very little. This is the first movie/book that has allowed me to really understand some of the decisions that were made part way through world war 2."
"Nolan's greatest weakness as a filmmaker has always been found in the convoluted stories he tells. When he gets lost in parts of it to a level that the story itself gets lost as well (see: Tenet). By the nature of this story, he was already protected from that. With that safety net in place, he soared to wonderful heights. This may well be the best cast he has ever assembled for a film, and they carry it beautifully. It is a deeply troubling film that causes us to look ourselves in the mirror. Is the prize worth the price? This will undoubtedly, and deservedly, garner several Oscar nominations, as it should. This very well could go down as Nolan's greatest film. A wonderful achievement given his catalogue."
"This movie is quite different from Nolan's usual style. As the title suggests, it primarily focuses on Oppenheimer's life rather than the anticipated nuclear blasts. The highly hyped nuclear blast scene didn't meet the grand expectations, though it did create some tension for a short while.Instead of being a typical blockbuster, the film leans more towards a documentary and courtroom drama, exploring historical events and personal stories. Viewers should manage their expectations accordingly. With a three-hour runtime, it requires a certain level of commitment from the audience, making it essential to have a good understanding of physics and history to fully appreciate the film and avoid potential boredom."
"Frankly I was incredibly disappointed. Nolan at his best captures his audience with incredible cinematography, sound and, most importantly, narrative. Oppenheimer has incredible cinematography and sound, but lacks sorely in narrative. The actors did what they could, which I might say was a fantastic job, but Nolan simply couldn't keep focus on a few but compelling narratives, but instead shot off in all kinds of directions with multiple plots. It caused an incredibly exhausting and, dare I say, boring experience. Let's make something clear; a movie has to first and foremost be entertaining and then it can layer the entertainment with visuals and sounds. Oppenheimer did it the other way around, except the entertaining part never actually arrived."
Tells a brilliant story about one of the most influential people in recent history. The nitty details about Oppenheimer's life are mesmerizing. Everything from his affair which ultimately semi-led to his downfall to how he orchestrated one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of all time captured how this man needs more recognition. This picture paints his story very well with a lot of aspects covered that would not normally be in the limelight. Performances from Murphy and Downey Jr were captivating and gave truth to the history which once was. The cameos we're not unneeded and the practical affects were jaw dropping.
"Movie was fine. I was expecting more physics and engineering and excitement of real science and emotional phases of Oppenheimer, suspense before tests, not focus on trivial human trials by dumb politicians. Since its about great geniuses, i cant rate it low. Could have been better!Could focus on collecting all the scientists, building up of the town in middle of nowhere. How the russian spy worked to transport message. The emotional phases, debate for righteousness. Suspense during testing. Betting on quantity of explosion. How technical and engineering marvel was achieved. Not knowing if it works, etc. Its nice, but could had been one of the great movie of all time. Missed the chance."
"Wow, what a monumental & sensational film! Nolan reinvents the three-Act structure to extraordinary effect. Oppenheimer is an intense and thrilling film that grabs a hold of your attention from the first frame and never let's you go. A mesmerising and powerful drama that unfolds like a thriller; Nolan builds the tension to a breathtaking climax, but thereafter does not let go, when it morphs into a thrilling and tense courtroom drama. The performances are all uniformly incredible, but Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Junior, Emily Blunt and Jason Clarke are the clear standouts. Every performance is a fully realised characterisation. Nolan has crafted a masterful film with the highest technical achievement, from the cinematography, to the production design, to the film's epic and haunting score from Ludwig Gorranson. This is Nolan's masterpiece!"
"A mind-blowing masterpiece of cinema Oppenheimer is not just a movie, it's an experience. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself once again, creating a stunning biopic that explores the life and legacy of one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. The film is a visual feast, shot in IMAX and 65mm film, with breathtaking cinematography and practical effects. The cast is phenomenal, especially Cillian Murphy, who delivers a career-best performance as the brilliant and tormented J. Robert Oppenheimer. The screenplay is smart, complex, and emotional, weaving together historical facts and artistic liberties in a captivating way. The music by Ludwig Göransson is haunting and powerful, enhancing the mood and tension of every scene. Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the praise and awards it can get. It's a must-see for anyone who loves movies, history, science, or just great storytelling. It's the best film of 2023, and possibly of all time."
"The film lasts approximately 3 hours, it is more like a Documentary. Where all the problems that arose when creating the Atomic Bomb are analyzed. The performance of Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy, among others. It has no discussion, very good actors. The R rating is for about 3 nudity sex scenes. But outside of that, it's all talk and talk. They are also suspicious of historical data that were previously secret. We hope it will be nominated for an Oscar, even though true stories are almost never awarded. People compare the Barbie Movie with Oppenheimer, when it cannot be like that, since Barbie is all fictional and its rating is PG-13, when Oppenheimer is a true story with an R rating. I recommend it to 95% to see it, it is very good. Go see it!!"
"This is unlike any other movie Nolan has made until now. While going to the theaters, I thought this movie would be about Manhattan project and the psychological effects of the bombings on Robert Oppenheimer, about how he thought he was responsible for the deaths and misery caused by his creation but this movie is much more than that.It is about the malicious propaganda he had to fight against to protect his reputation and his credibility. It is ironic that the man who built the atomic bomb for America hard to prove his loyalty to his country. This movie dives deep into human behaviour and shows just how blind humans can be because of our ego and our ignorance to reality.The way this complex storyline is made into a film is masterful to say the least."
"If you take out all the hype and all the famous actor. The movie its just a 6. Good sounds, good camera. But the movie itself its not the best Christopher Nolan movie, so my best bet its that the hype its just a popular opinion affected by the hype of everyone and all the actors involed.As a Christopher Nolan movie, i was waiting some more action or at least a recreation of the bomb at Japan. But not even that.Also the movie its a bit too long. Probably they can cut like 20 min of the movie and the result would have been the same.I hope people read this to not go to see the movie with a big hype."
"I expected a movie centered around nuclear war and the potential annihilation of the planet to be more captivating, but it just wasn't. Once again Christopher Nolan is semi-redeemed by terrific acting and a great cast, which is perhaps the only redeemable thing about this trash heap of a film. Truthfully I just couldn't wait for it to end...but it just wouldn't.The fact that this is rated so highly absolutely baffles me. Are our standards for film this low now? Last time I throw my money away supporting a film from arguably the most overrated director in the history of film. Christopher Nolan, you are a such a BORE."
This is one of those movies that makes you want to learn more. Not only was the story told with such vivid images without showing any. The acting is emotionally complex and layered. The sound track was amazing. The use of silence was amazing. Loved everything about this movie and plan to watch again and again.It's definitely a movie that needs multiple viewings since there are so many pieces to the story. It's not as simple as one man's actions. The use of color and lack of in areas to define the time was incredibly helpful to follow a complex story. Rarely do I feel movies leave the viewer's having conversations about morality and a view on how devastating technology can be. This is one. Just an amazing movie.
"Go see it in Imax and the slight increased ticket price is worthy of your money, it's a visual and audible feast, good value entertainment is hard to come by these days and this delivers. I'd dissuade anyone from going just for the explosion this is a biopic based around a key point in Oppenheimer's life, not just building a bomb. After reading some reviews I thought it'd be challenging to keep up with a few timelines but it was a breeze, the pace although on the fast side makes for compelling storytelling. The score and sound are perfect and exactly what you'd expect from Imax, the well placed/timed loudness adds to the experience and makes this a well constructed immersive look into the life of a controversial historical figure. Just on my way to binge all Nolan's movies now."
"This movie is 3 hours long, and in this time it tries not to be boring for the viewer. The intense shifts of flashbacks and flashforwards are keeping the movie fascinationg to watch. The scenes from Oppenheimer's life and other people related to him is like a puzzle, that is interesting to collide into the whole chronological picture.The visuals are stunning, montage is fast-pased and never getting boring, and dialogues with music can definitely tell you that this is Christopher Nolan's movie.I eould re-watch it at the future, because I would like to understand story more. It already is turning to the cult classic. This movie exists to become one.One of the concerns I have-the moment of atomic explosion. The buildup was massive, but compared to it, the explosion felt flat and not-impactful."
"Kuch khas nahi hai bomb hota hai fat jata hai bich me angrez bolte rhete haiIt's just a meme incase you don't know
jokes apart it's christophar nolan movie,
He is GOAT ( GREAT OF ALL TIME )
literally masterpiece i really loved and enjoy this movie awesome cinematography
And storytelling part by part he is always unique in storytelling I love this experience while watching at Inox just beleive me and cancel your all plans which (if it's not important don't cancel job interview or your marriage) and go and watch this movie you will thank me later it's probably the best 500 rs you have ever spend."
"I just watched the most amazing movie ever and I can't wait to share my thoughts with you! It was a masterpiece of storytelling, cinematography, acting, and music. The plot was captivating, the characters were complex and relatable, the visuals were stunning, and the soundtrack was perfect. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, laughing, crying, and cheering. It was an emotional roller coaster that left me breathless and satisfied. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves cinema and wants to experience something unforgettable. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen and I'm sure you'll agree with me once you watch it too!"
"Oppenheimer combines both stunning visual and audio experiences! From the beginning of the movie all till the end, you can find yourself on the edge of your seat. The way Christopher Nolan is able to capture the fear in the characters is uncanny. Cilian Murphy delivers extraordinary acting and I'm sure he will be up for an Oscar nomination. The fact that there is not one single shot of CGI further proves the fact of how amazing Nolan's directing is. The movie centers around the man and not the bomb and 3 hours of runtime went so fast no one actually felt it due to the grasp of the story. Thank you, Nolan, for delivering the story of the modern Prometheus in such a way!"
"It is possible to combine science and politics with a very deep and catastrophic story, a very rigid and complex protagonist, and a very rich and enjoyable middle and end, despite the number of important and historical names and characters in that context to understand and not miss any detail.A masterpiece by Nolan with a perfect cast, where Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Extraordinarily highlight his talent, surprising me a little more Robert, with his acting quality at the height that this film deserves.It is a spectacular movie. A film with a very strong and dramatic context. Nolan gets almost everything right here."
"I just watched this movie, and it is an ambitious film in portraying Robert Oppenheimer. The cast which you may know were in the movie and some you didn't know had small roles were all excellent. I thought Murphy and RDJ were the standouts. The one role who I thought seemed superfluous was Florence Pugh's character. To me she didn't seem too vital to the story aside from seeing her boobs in IMAX. Nolan could've put anyone in that role, and it would have had the same superficial effect. Aside from that the only quibble I have is the score is sometimes so loud that I could NOT understand what some of the characters were saying. As for the rest of the film it was relentless in telling Oppenheimer's story. It was as well made as cinema can get nowadays. You were absolutely immersed in the mid to late 40's . So much so that if you aren't a person even mildly knowledgeable about the subject then you may get lost as this film does not hold your hand in explaining what is occurring."
"This movie is not what we all have been conditioned to through DC and Marvel movies. Therefore , I urge you not to listen to the haters. Nolan truly takes us through a journey of Oppenheimers life. One can expect to go through various emotions while watching this movie. The cinematography was excellent and acting by all actors was brilliant. The movie does have some technical words from physics that may be tough for some to understand. Especially those who have a small attention span. In an era of tik tok, reels and short movies with lots of action, Nolan makes a movie that demands your attention and it doesn't feel too long. It's brilliant. I want to Thank Christopher Nolan for giving us the masterpiece. We are truly witnessing a genius at work. I am also thankful to all the actors for their brilliant performance."
"For me, maybe, the best biographical film of all times.Finally, after a long time, a blockbuster that really had a script, where it was only about a great camera, editing and sound. Nolan made one of his best films. For me - better than Tenet and maybe even better than Interstellar. It's magnificent, deep, it has a lot of references and ideas to work with, and at the same time it's so cut that you enjoy it from start to finish. Maybe almost to the end - and that's the only complaint. A couple of cuts in the second half might have improved the audience's experience, but I'm already digging into the work, which is otherwise almost perfect. A return to honest filmmaking in Hollywood."
Excellent movie ! There's some astonishing execution of the views and the things and the acting was top class .... These kinda movies are really rare and worth watching ... The roles were perfectly presented and executed and every detail was looked over precisely.. I mean I have seen people making some funny reels and memes on it as they couldn't understand but honestly I couldn't connect more and be indulged in it and it needs patience and focus to feel it ... so it wasn't meant for the ones looking for fun or casual enjoyment but it was meant for the actual good contented watchers . I would recommend people to look for themselves and not be influenced by the reels and memes people are making !
From the moment the movie started it set a tone which got the viewers ready for a new level of cinema. This movie will be known for changing cinema in a good way.I usually don't write reviews so for me to actually make a review and post it shows the level of detail this movie has on the audience. This movie was made for the cinema theatres making it a unique experience in cinema. This movie will be labelled as one of the all time greats by a generation cast and director. Cillian Murphy for the Oscar with this movie being the best for the year with nothing coming close to the level of detail.
"This movie was absolutely fantastic. Quick paced. The score was powerful and emotional. Acting was exceptional. The last 45 mins were a bit much for me, so I'll take away a star for that. Also the nudity was unnecessary. You could have communicated the romantic tension without it, so I remove a star for that as well. Doing a little research on the biography of Oppenheimer afterwards, I believe the movie was very faithful to his character and personal life. Over all, I believe Christopher Nolan's film was a masterpiece that will always be remembered positively. As long as that movie was, I can't wait to see it again."
"The acting in this film is fascinating and the cast is absolutely stellar. It's an interesting story and certainly would have deserved a 9 were it not for two major flaws that are common in movies these days but taken to absurd excess here. First, the sound. It was so muffled and echoey, and the music and sound effects were so overwhelming, that my friends and I missed at least a third of the dialog. Since the drama depended on the dialog, this was a serious error in judgment. At times, it was obvious something very humorous was occurring in the dialog, but the entire audience just sat in confused silence trying to figure out what was going on. And then there were the frequent changes in scene. Just as you are settling into a scene, suddenly the story jumps to a different city, with different people, in a different decade. Between the inaudible dialog and the frenetic changes in scene, the film was often difficult to follow. I look forward to watching this with subtitles to see what I missed."
"This biography of J Robert Oppenheimer can be told in 1 hr 30 min max. It has been stretched for 3 hrs don't know why which has made this film very boring. Didn't expect this from Nolan. Instead of showing only dialogues in the entire film for 3hrs straight he should have added atleast some action sequence..
I thought that after the interval maybe this movie will pick up some speed but no it was only dialogues the entire time...dont know why people are liking this trash film. I was expecting something like interstellar or atleast some action sequence. Apart from all this boring stuff the cinematography was good as it was shot on IMAX and cgi wasn't used so if that is a good reason for you to watch this film you can go ahead but I wont recommend this movie to watch in the movie theatre, wait for it to come in the OTT."
"This is one of the greatest cinematic experience a person can have and it is the best movie after interstellar in my opinion the visuals are perfect the cinematography is outstanding. The acting is commendable especially the acting of Cillian Murphy and Emily blunt. The personal and professional life of Oppenheimer is portrayed beautiful. And the Mastermind behind all this Christopher Nolan again gives us a Masterpiece which will be talked about till decades. At last everyone should experience this movie and that to in cinema theaters because this movie is made for that and on a TV, laptop,mobile etc screen will not give you the perfect experience."
The story itself was a disappointment for all human beings and spiritual people are living in Japan. But showing them as a hero with people that they destroy countries I don't see the point over here. And mixing it with lots of emotions that went so deep.My total conclusion for the story and people did participate on this shameful work is -1/10. Is not a hero thing from both sides.In every country and city are many heroes that they are not known now. But I assure everyone now are building the history and one day people will talk about them. That's why never down grade yourself or anyone you know.
"A Masterpiece in every sense of the word, the editing and masterful score kept me invested and engaged during the whole 180 minutes.The sound kept me on my toes, and the performances are so DAMN good. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon show that they are absolute elite performers. Alden Ehrenreich was the surprise package, fantastic everytime he was on screen.The trinity test sequence is one of the best movie scenes this century, my favorite of the year.Nolan's best movie since Inception and if he doesn't win the Best Director Oscar for this, I'm afraid he will never win it, and I personally thing that would be a tragedy."
"What a masterpiece... Everything designed by Nolan without CGI. You know when a movie directing by Christopher Nolan,you gotta see that movie on IMAX that's an unwritten rule and I can easily say this was the best IMAX experience that i've ever had. The quality of sounds was made me feel like I'm inside of the movie. Especially,this cast OMG! Even the less important role in the movie was played by an actor who has at least Oscar or any award. Probably only Nolan or Tarantino would bring them together and seeing this movie,learning all kinda things about the facts in the history was an indescribable experience."
"It's by far Christopher Nolan's best work and easily the best movie released in the last 10 years. It is a little bit long coming in at 3 hours and 9 minutes, but it's worth it.It's a star studded cast that actually delivers, unlike some of the ones in the past with that many superstars in one movie. Cillian Murphy delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Robert Downing, Jr., despite playing to roll of a horrible person, gives his best acting performance to date. The fact that Florence Pugh is only in like 8 scenes just shows the star power this movie has.Overall, it is a masterpiece and a must see."
This is Christopher Nolan's terrific Excellent gripping intense movie to Date despite the 3 hour runtime this movie flew by very quickly Cillian Murphy is excellent in the role of Robert J Oppenheimer I really hope he gets nominated for the Oscars for best actor also Robert Downey jr Is fantastic in this movie as well Matt Damon is incredible in this movie also Kenneth Branagh is great in movie Emily blunt is also great in this film go see this movie on the biggest screen you can go watch this movie in IMAX Or IMAX 70mm this is the best movie of 2023 this film is my number 1 favourite Nolan movie after Dunkirk.
"Perfect literally perfect , the famous oppenheimer speech was done so good by Nolan/Cillian Murphy and this movie is not good its a masterpiece that should be no only Oscar winning but best film ever award.if u haven't watched this and ur reading these reviews just know this is a massive loss if u don't watch this in imax or cinema alone , I rarely go cinema but this was a must and such brilliant actors in it , build up was perfect ending was perfect and the bomb well wow never experienced a heart attack until that moment I was so nervous when I was counting down and when I went off wow I was so worried and scared and wow what a film , watch now!!!!!!!- Jack wing."
"This film is both interesting and fast paced for a three hour film it doesn't drag, could not recommend this film any higher and cillian Murphys performance is as good as anything I have ever seen. His character is supported well by one of the best casts in recent yrs high praise to Emily blunt and Florence Pugh ( another great role by her )
Could not seriously think of a negative part of this film instant classic.The switch between black and white to colour is such a good idea , trying so hard to write this without giving any spoilers or giving anything away
Just what a film am so impressed by Nolan again one of the best directors of our time."
Oppenheimer Movie is a combo of father of atomic bomb a biopic + documentary script with good direction and screenplay. The background score was good .Normal audience expecting action scenes will not enjoy the movie. Its complete dialogue based movie. The cinematography was good. Emotions has missed in the movie. However the Director has kept the words in Sanskrit in wrong scenes where the director needs to apologies the public. The performance was good .The characters were well executed from the director and performance were well executed from all cast. Mostly this movie will be getting the awards in the future. Overall my rating 2.9/5.
"Holy moly . Where do I start . I was dreading going to watch a movie three hours long but Wow , just wow . This movie does not feel long as you get sucked in to the story and the excellent performances by Cillian Murphy , Robert downy JR and the rest of the excellent A list cast .The movie is truly a masterpiece in cinema , as directing , editing , acting , soundstage are all wonderful. It's like reliving an era in the past and the cast has done an immense job of immersing themselves into the characters they played .Do not make the mistake of going in to watch a movie about the bomb. It's more about the father of the bomb and how he was treated afterwards and certainly will not disappoint you."
"My brother and have been fans of Cillian Murphy since the dark knight and more recently peaky blinders. We planned to go see this months in advance. We saw it Saturday opening weekend at 1145p. Not the smartest idea considering it was 3 hours long. Ok. I came in with high expectations. It's Nolan. It's Murphy, Downey, Blunt, Damon, and much more. Listen. I couldn't stop thinking about this movie. Not just the historical significance but its brilliance as well. I was blown away. I forgot about the time. A cinematic masterpiece. In a world full of superhero films and over the top CGI. I needed this. So good. I really enjoy the little gestures of each character and the little bread crumbs Nolan leaves throughout the film that round it out in the end. At one point I was sad thinking the movie was over and then upon glancing at the time realized there was an hour left. The best was yet to come."
"Christopher Nolan depicts an epic biopic of the life of Oppenheimer. There isn't a single flaw with this movie. The pacing is perfect, with the use of time jumps Nolan provides an entertaining look into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The artistic use of black, white and color gives the viewer two different perspectives on the movie. The acting performances from Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey jr and the entire supporting cast are nothing short of exceptional and just go to show that Nolan's casting is perfect. Once again Nolan has proven he is not limited by genre by making his best work. Truly a masterpiece, I expect it will pick up various awards as what I believe to be movie of the year."
"Bombastic, loud, style over substance.So, it's a Nolan film.Making a sympathetic hero out of a mass murderer always feels tone deaf. This is no exception. For all the attempts to make ol' Oppy seem conflicted and troubled, it never really examines the impact of his choices. It does the usual things these biopics as spectacle do and overemphasises it's ""hero"" to the detriment of countless other historical figures. The way it's presented here, Oppy was the entire Manhattan Project and associated tests with a few hapless slack jawed helpers orbiting his ego.You'd be better off and better educated watching an actual documentary rather than this sanitised version of reality."
"Having just returned from the cinema, I am left speechless by the brilliance of 'Oppenheimer,' and I must say that Cillian's performance as the lead actor is truly outstanding. This movie has transported me to another dimension with its powerful and impactful scenes. It is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen, and Cillian's portrayal adds an exceptional depth to the film. Cillian's portrayal of the character was nothing short of mesmerizing, leaving a lasting impression on my mind. The movie's ability to evoke such intense emotions is a testament to its brilliance. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an unforgettable cinematic experience."
"Oppenheimer is an excellent personal history and a story of international cooperation in physics. There is an interest in philosophy and morality, but no understanding of the actions and consequences. All the time there is too much political witch hunt and game in the US and too few mentions and scenes of the effects of radiation, humanitarian crisis and suffering in Japan.The film could have used many more pictures of the victims and a reminder that nuclear power should never have been used in history and should not be used in warfare in the future, not in this decade and not in the decades to come.An apology is completely absent at state level."
"This was one of those movies that leave you thinking and speechless at the end. Walked out of the theater and not one person said a word. Extremely, EXTREMELY compelling. The story was told in the greatest way possible. Thank you Nolan. Haven't been to the movies in roughly 8 years, to see this in Imax (digital cause the film reel broke but bought another ticket for 70mm in a week cause I am such a big fan of this film) was one of the greatest experiences a film nerd could've witnessed. The story telling, themes, plots, timing, was beyond perfect. Kept people wrapped to their seats until the very end."
"I waited so long to see the film, and it was worth it. I'm a big Christopher Nolan fan and I've seen his most popular films and I had high hopes for the film.The visuals of the film were beautiful and the cinematography made the film enjoyable. However, the pace was a little slow and at times felt a little boring. Although I expected more from the film, it was still surprisingly well done.I thought the film would have been more about the atomic bombs, but the film was about Oppenheimer as the title is Oppenheimer. And don't get me wrong, i am totally fine with that. Oppenheimer is a great historical figure that everyone should know about.I highly recommend going to see the film as soon as possible and if you can then choose the imax theatre."
"Terrible film overhyped and mislead you with an outstanding cast and director. Unfortunately the film lacked execution and suspense. It was too one dimensional and totally boring!!! That is to put it plain and simple.The acting is what gives this 1 out of 10 rather than 0, the story itself could have been condensed to 1 hour and 30 mins. So many people left the cinema because it dragged on and like hey dude, why create a bomb kill a hundred thousand plus then feel guilty about it?The storylines are not real and all fake. Overall a poor poor film which was so boring and I wish I could get 180mins of my life bacm."
"From the direction of Christopher Nolan. To the amazing soundtrack that makes every intense scene get you on the edge of your seat. To the beautiful acting of Cillian Murphy, and Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt, and so many more. When I went to the theater watching this film, I thought in the back of my head that I knew the story and I knew the outcome. But Christopher Nolan still manages to dive deep down in reveal the story in ways I never thought. It's gonna be one of the best movies for a very long time. The only thing I can say is go out watch this movie. And do not miss a second of it because every scene and every word spoken matters. I can't wait to see what Christopher Nolan cooks up next!"
"A typical Nolan film that forces the audience to have full engagement and use their head throughout the entire film to fully understand the surrounding plot. The plot is designed perfectly and depicts Oppenheimers life much more deeply than I suspected walking into the theatre. The cinematography was beautiful, as expected with Nolan. The music and theme was fantastic. The acting was absolutely phenomenal, and Nolan's ability to build each character deeply was crucial to the plot. Finally, the ending was perfect, it brought everything together and gave the audience a chilling sensation as they left the theatre with a jaw dropping experience."
"This movie will become a classic. I watched this movie in theaters and it will certainly take a while to process. Its essentially a biography of Oppenheimer's life, but with a focus on the period around the manhattan project. It was truly a very ponderous movie that presents many moral questions, especially pertaining to the the atomic bomb. The inclusion of practical effects by Christopher Nolan added levels of realism and immersion that left me feeling like I was really at the trinity test. I left the theater astounded. My only strife might be that the short nudity and sex scenes didn't really add much to the story. Overall an exceptional film."
"When I had wached this movie I gave it 9/10 because of missing some details as the first half of the movie was so fast and there had been alot of names but when I rewatched it my rate is 10/10 . At the second watch I understood everything the timeline in the movie was alittle bet hard to understand but when yous see that for second time its wow . Cillian Murphy's performance deserves oscar , even his eyes was acting he was really the best cast . Robert Downey Jr. I wished he has more scenes but his scenes in the second part of the movie was really good and I forgot that I am watching Tony Stark. Mat Damon and Emily Blunt were also lovely. The most thing I have loved in the movie is the sound effects it made super atmosphere. Finally I love to say Nolan is GOAT."
"The movies indeed has excellent story telling and it is very long complex story, covering it in 3 hours should be challenging task, but but are talking about Christopher Nolan, so it will be casual for him. I'm saying it, is and should be excellent a movie. I confess I did not understand all the movie, I think will take 4 or 5 times of watching.(I don't have five hundred characters for fill my movie review to post this review, so I'm posting my predicaments of filling five hundred characters in the review so it become five hundred characters. Oh god it need more characters, twenty more to go. Done)"
"I walk out on very few movies and this was the third movie I have walked out on. I'm glad to hear I didn't miss much as the remaining 1.5 hours were the same. I kept asking myself when will the movie get good? This movie started reminding me about working with all the men in my field and how all of them want to be masters of the universe. There are no interesting characters. I would've enjoyed a movie about WW2 more. In fact, even Pearl Harbor was more enjoyable than this bore.Wasted talent and money about really nothing. Truly insignificant about a significant event in history. Wasted and disappointing. At least the marketing department worked."
"Just out after watching this movie. Nolan is maturing well and how. The story telling has become simpler (vis-a-vis Prestige for example :P). Has an Amadeus touch to the story line. Cinematography, lighting and camera work is superb and lends itself well to the story telling. Nolan remains customer obsessed as ever, treating his audience with intellectual respect. The actors are extremely good and the best compliment to them is that you don't feel them. Only thing which could be better was the music.Science (Quantum physics) serves as the background color of the movie but it is neither necessary or expected to understand all of it nuances to understand the movie. Don't get too bothered by the science jargons unless you are interested."
"If this movie does not win an Oscar for the best picture of the year... One of the best movies of all time, PERIOD! There is not a better way to portrait a story of the father of the atomic bomb and Christopher Nolan is the only guy right now, who could have done it. So many A-list actors. Through out the movie, you see more and more familiar faces, such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. It never felt too long. We are so lucky to live in this era of Hollywood and to witness such movies. And what makes this movie even better, that there is ZERO CGI. Everything you see (or will see) is practical.God bless Cillian Murphy, RDJ, Chris Nolan."
"Every things is perfect a great piece from Christopher Nolan there is no mistake in it and absolutely there is no movie greater than this
it does not disappointed me at all what can i say
i hope will be more movies like this in the future
Christopher Nolan respect the art in his work and this movie an Example how cinema industry should be the acting is Historical i think the crew will sweep the Oscar awards and of course the music was the bomb in this year
this film will be in my mind so long to forget it is my favorite film thank for reading my article about this great work and this is everything."
"Stop comparing Oppenheimer to anything at all what's important is everyone knowing the truth about J robert Oppenheimer, people are supporting a fictional character movie instead of a biography of the greatest person ever existed, his sufferings, the misbehave, the boycott, the pain, Oppenheimer changed the world, Oppenheimer ended world war, Oppenheimer invented the great thing ever to exist, but people think something else is more important than that, but people laughed in the hall where Oppenheimer was playing, the sad thing is that people don't even understand the movie this movie is a feeling."
"I watched this film. I went to see this film considering it as a film made on science fiction and scientific community, but in this 3-hour film, the story went on for only 15 to 20 minutes, after that there was a heated debate about American communist politics in closed rooms.I had read that Oppenheimer had an affinity for Bhagwat Gita but added that too to his sex scene.Those who are in the mood to watch it as a film based on the research of atomic bomb, they will find it very boring, but those who are interested in American communist politics, they might like something.But acting of Cillian Muphy was excellent."
The best movie in 2023 fo sure the movie deserves a oscar award it was fantastic i loved everything about the movie and the story i loved the movie you must watch it The best movie in 2023 fo sure the movie deserves a oscar award it was fantastic i loved everything about the movie and the story i loved the movie you must watch it The best movie in 2023 fo sure the movie deserves a oscar award it was fantastic i loved everything about the movie and the story i loved the movie you must watch it The best movie in 2023 fo sure the movie deserves a oscar award it was fantastic i loved everything about the movie and the story i loved the movie you must watch it.
"I love Nolan's films for their ability to pierce my mind with emotions, to bring tears. I didn't expect it to be the same with this biographical drama, but I was wrong. Repeatedly catching the state of numbness of the body, a lump in the throat and the inability to move, the tears themselves came out involuntarily. A whirlwind of wonderful visuals and an unsurpassed musical part just slams you into the cinema seat and keeps you in suspense for a long time.The actors are at their best, Murphy is probably at the peak of his career in this motion picture. We will certainly see him holding the Best Actor soon.Definitely recommend and look forward to watching again."
"If you look somewhere else for a brief second you will miss a key detail or a line and it really ruins your day , for a three hour movie it really is hard to focus and understand but if you manage to stand still it really makes you think about perspectives and peoples point of view ,other than that it really is a masterpiece. You really feel the view of Oppenheimer and it makes you think about how unsecure people believe the whole world shapes around them. At the end though i dont have any think to say really, for a Nolan movie you probably can not leave the movie theater more satisfied and relieved."
"The good: excellent performances by Murphy, Damon and especially Downey. A couple of powerful scenes, especially of the first test of the atom bomb - literally mind blowing .The bad: disjointed and confusing storytelling. Characters are plopped in and we have no idea who they are or their significance. Bombastic score that never lets up. At 3 hours way overlong.I was so looking forward to seeing this film, especially after the critical huzzahs for it and I'm a fan of all the talent involved. Well, folks, we've been misled by the critics yet again. Quite a few walkouts at the screening that I attended."
"In my opinion, Nolan made an excellent movie that talks about Oppenheimer, the plot is not only about the atomic bomb, it also has to do with the Manhattan project and what happened after using the bomb, the cast is perfect, all the performances are good, but the performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt are spectacular, Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack is very good, the direction and photography is impeccable, I loved that they didn't use cgi, for all those reasons it's one of my movies Nolan's favorites and they will possibly win many Oscars For example, Best Supporting Actor for Robert Downey Jr. Best Picture and the Oscar for Cillian Murphy."
"This is just a cinematic masterpiece, but, the minutes leading to the bomb test moment and reaching that climax... the entire room just suddenly became absolutely silent. You couldn't even hear people breathing, it would literally be possible to hear a fly... what a moment that was. From that moment on until the end of the movie every body was apprehensive. I think is the best way to put it.The visuals, the sound, the storytelling, the performances, what an actual masterpiece. In my opinion this is the 2 best C. Noland movie (only toped by interstellar).If you can please watch it in IMax, it is worth it."
Best acting performance ive ever seen in my entire life robert downy junior deserves an oscar.Cillian murphy has delivered the best acting performance in his career and florence pugh was stunning the cinematography is amazing the pomb scene was so sudden and unexpected I really loved it. Best acting performance ive ever seen in my entire life robert downy junior deserves an oscar.Cillian murphy has delivered the best acting performance in his career and florence pugh was stunning the cinematography is amazing the pomb scene was so sudden and unexpected I really loved it. Best movie this year and it could be best movie in this century.
"This movie is insane! It has everything and Nolan is able to pace it so well, all the tension during dialogue, movie of the century. Not to mention all the great actors and actresses, wow Cillian Murphy was phenomenal, his eyes could talk, Emily Blunt nailed it with the so called non trial scene, Matt Damon was very subtle but his acting was so deep and solid, last but not least, RDJ was so great, we all know he's great but he was under the ironman shadow, he shook it off so damn well.To summarize, Oppenheimer is not just a movie, it's literally ART, I would say it's my favorite Nolan movie, it's slow when it needed to, it's fast when it needed to. The atmosphere and the pace is PERFECT. Definitely a must-see movie, I stopped drinking and eating three hours before watching Oppenheimer, and it's worth every bit of my efforts, it lives up to the hype."
"This film is great. Visually Stunning. Sound Mixing is top tier. I saw this a day before theatrical release in IMAX and if you want to get the full IMAX Experience, let it be this one. Whether you see it in IMAX or not you will fall in love with this film. But seeing it the way it was intended to be seen, it is an other worldly experience. The performances in this film are just phenomenal. Murphy is completely absorbed into this character and it is very clear through the screen. Emily Blunt also gives a very strong performance on screen, to be frank, she crushes it. Flat out. All I have to say is, see Oppenheimer in IMAX."
"The acting and directing are amazing. The lines hidden within every series of act will stuck with you. Very precise storytelling, it make you feel what exactly how you have to feel with every minute of it. The plots are complex but not confusing. All the conversations put together can be a little overwhelming, but overall, it draws back to the point every once in a while. Cillian Murphy is killing it, an awesome acted piece, same, makes you feel exactly how you need to feel with Oppenheimer. You can easily cry hard just watching the takes of his big close ups. The whole cast wonderfully acted as well. The soundtrack, the editing, it's a film with all fine arts putting together."
"Nolan is back again in the game. Always using great shots, good actors, nagnificent performances and scenarios, making it ideal. The trama is good, it keeps you in the edge of your seat, nail bitting conversations, and helping with the memory on flashbacks to the characters with a lot of lastnames and not too many background for each (except Einstein), to improve the experience of the mlvie. Even with 3 hours long, it never felt like more than a 2 hour film, because it was so intense and you are so deep in the trama, that you dont see the time flow. Romantic scenes are short and precise, so it is a great overal movie to watch. Band reminds you to interstellar and Batman, so it is a great gesture. Psycho is intense with mind blowing scenes that leave you thinking on what could happen.Nolan, you are GREAT once more."
"This movie has reached its expectations and was even better. The story telling of this movie was absolute Masterpiece and told us everything about oppenheimers life, told us what was happening in his head. The cinematography of this movie was also amazing but what else can you expect from Christopher Nolan. The pacing of this movie was almost perfect and I have enjoyed every second of this movie. I have felt every emotion that oppie has felt and I had the feeling that I have lived those moments. I loved the process and the switches between black and white and colourful cinema. The scene when the bomb went off had my heart pounding and the end had me thinking for many days. Plus the music was excellent. One of the best endings of a movie if not the best. AMAZING 10/10 must watch in IMAX for the full experience."
"I have just read an article from CNN where they say that Openheimer is a film about the history of the creation of the atomic bomb.Openheimer is the strongest film since The People v. Larry Flynt, about a man being judged by the US for thinking differently from what he was allowed to think. The atomic bomb is secondary. This is a brilliant movie. With a great script and a very good team of actors who flawlessly reveal their characters. Downey Jr. Is plays his best role.By the way, it is surprising that it came out right now. In a new round of the Cold War. This is probably why CNN is trying to simplify it so that prevent people from thinking like Openheimer."
"As usual Nolan had directed this movie in multiple timelines and also using black and white effect. Story of scientist said by sound effects. I heard in marketing event Nolan boasting about no VFX but only to makeup with the sound effects.Definitely not that great as inception and interstellar. Murphy, daemon, Robert were amazing and really blended well into their roles. If you compare with Chernobyl it's not that great. Gravity is not kept throughout the movie and it's tried to hype with bringing names of very renowned scientists! Could have been directed in better way considering the star cast of movie.."
"This movie is a literal masterpiece. One of the best movies I have seen. The story is truly astonishing, the cinematography wonderful. It feels like there is always something happening in the movie, its a complex story with lots of ups and downs but i you actually get the story and what is happening, it feels like a truly amazing film. Probably will be the best movie of the year. I will recommend this film to anyone just maybe not children under 14 because of sex scenes in some parts of the movie. I love to watch it again and experience this astonishing movie. I cant say nothing more than just go and watch the movie, cant say anything about it."
"I cannot find a word to express how I felt watching the movie, and not even a word to explain how I felt after. This film is at the top of the top, I believe this might be the best film in history and I am serious about that. I even feel grateful for being able to experience this journey. Nolan simply doesn't stop impressing, and I would like to thank him for creating this masterpiece. Cillian Murphy delivered the best performance I've seen, he was incredible. They deserve the oscars.The cinematography and sound was out of this world, you have to experience this work of art in the biggest cinema screen you can find, of course, better if it is 70mm IMAX."
"The film is packed with emotions, one of the best dialogues, the storyline, the acting special mention Cilian Murphy, the direction, the cinematography everything every bit of it is an art and Christopher Nolan is the artist. Hats off to the VFX and CGI team for there work. You don't get attached to the screen immediately but you will eventually. The film takes its time which is most beautiful aspect of it and when the work is done it shows the excellence of the director the on the screen. Somehow every person in the hall stays focused and enjoys the film. For me it was avlast experience do tell yours."
"There's not a single moment without background score, except for the bomb explosion. It always bothers me when a film requires background music for everything, even quiet conversations, that nothing is good enough to survive without musical support. Also bleach bypassing IMAX seems a real waste - why use a lab process that increases grain and reduces contract ratio on the highest resolution film medium available? It all feels pretty one note, style over substance. Dry. Given Nolan's limitless resources it should be much more rounded. I didn't care about anyone, or even really get to know anyone, including Oppenheimer. Overall really disappointing and all the glowing reviews to me feel like everyone has drunk the Kool Aid. The emperor has no clothes. Not sure how much I'm influenced by having read the biography it's based on. Dr George Miller used to say that a film should feel like a great piece of music with highs, lows, quiet, crescendos, pacing. This feels like one very long chorus, and not a great one at that."
"Yet another massive achievement by Christopher Nolan; indeed a culmination of his entire life's work. Cillian Murphy exceeded expectations with his extraordinary performance. I'll be surprised if the man doesn't win an Oscar for this one. He was....something else. He was magical. The soundtrack was so brilliant, it almost carried the movie on its back; It made the simplest scenes/ shots of the movie SO incredibly powerful, I had goosebumps the entire time I was watching it. Every single actor (esp RDJ and Matt Damon) gave an incredibly special and memorable performance that I could not help but but wish to give them a big hug for the exceptional delivery. The movie was a tad bit long, but I believe that the extra time was needed to give the audience proper context, to ensure that the audience 'feels' the ending the way Nolan intended for them to. A masterpiece, truly."
"Master piece by the director. So many different angles to the movie and everyone's story seems to be true according to them. The Govt, the army, the physicists, the society all got their share, the chain reaction it started puts whole world on war. The music, intensity and picture quality is top class. The right moments, pauses and constant battle between conscience and duty. Right approach, right people and right team are must for any success. The whole world got another weapon that they can monetize and start a revolution. The little hints in dialogues and conversations are very well scripted."
"Christopher Nolan does it again Oppenheimer has got to be one of the best three hours that I've experienced in 2023. I was really excited about this movie when it was announced and it did not disappoint, even though it is three hours long I feel like that's the adequate amount of time that it needs. Cillian Murphy's performance of the character is just beautifully done, he nailed it. I was also a big fan of the music used in the background throughout the movie. It's just amazing the scenery that it takes place it's beautiful. I like how they tease you with the atomic bomb throughout the movie until the final moment. Cillian Murphy definitely deserve an Oscar for his performance."
"This film changed me, christopher Noland art of the cinema is at its greatest here and this experience is second to none other than interstellar. If you can, watch it. While the plot can be slightly complicated after the moment (which is without a doubt the most nerveracking scene ever made) the film still maintains its unbelievably powerful nature. I am someone who is rarely emotionally affected by films however this film was the second to ever make me shed tears. While I was close to crying the entire film, it finally broke at the intense ending, which I believe will stay with me for the rest of my life."
"In one's life some things that come along simply blow you away and this movie is one of those things,! The cast of this movie not only were well chosen and brilliant acted. This has to be seen. It's hard to review this movie and not give away too much, but it's a complete and immersive experience which also explains what goes on in the back ground. I simply knew that people built a nuclear bomb and that two of them were dropped on Japan which bought the end to world war 2. A terrible time in our history. The audience in the cinema we went to were very respectful and the brilliance of the movie is why I hope movies like this continue to be made."
"Biopics are often well presented and offer a deep storyline to keep you immersed. Nolan rightly chose to work on this film as I believe it's the best film I've ever seen. I'm lost for words when asked to describe my experience and thought of this film and I often resort to simple vocabulary like ""it was amazing"" or ""I loved it"" and not many people will recognise what I truly mean by that. Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan is a story based solely around J. Robert Oppenheimer, a Quantum Physicist who played a large role in the development of the atomic bomb. The film explores his life, his work and it is all presented through his eyes."
"What more can anyone say about Nolan movies!just his name on any poster make it an instant classic and blockbuster
The cinematography is at its best and soundtrack is really good and the acting from Robert Downey Jr is spectacular! Him and Cillian Murphy will be nominated for the Oscars for sure, and Emily blunt was great specially in a scene nearing the end of the movie.I just didn't like that Nolan treat us as we are all scientist I felt a little bit lost in the first half of the movie, for me the second half was really better.But overall great experience you have to experience it in cinema!."
"Solid 7.5. Great acting, great visuals, so-so editing. Nice to see Ciliian Murphy getting a leading role. No actor is better at acting w/o saying anything. It's the semi-watering eyes. I'll have to look into all the non-bomb making aspects of his life, I know so little. Didn't know about the commie ties, the losing security clearance (whatever), and all the rest. Ni ce to so many actors having 1-2 lines and doing a great job, I guess they all wanted to be in it. Musta sucked to be a part of making a weapon so powerful, but if they didn't someone else worse woulda. Anyway I'll never put on another life jacket."
"Spoilers ahead, please don't watch this, I know that I'm not a fan of Christopher Nolan's films. Oppenheimer is some of it was creatively weaved in, but the majority felt very pace-breaking and unnatural. The main hooks in the movie, Ludwig and the editing team made some amazing sequences, but for the most part, it's largely quite boring. It is profound to harness the strong force, and make a film about it - but there is a subtle self-importance to the film. It's the feeling of an artist knowing they create profound art, and the self awareness seeps into the art and you can feel it. It's hard to explain, but it's tangible in this film. Ever since Oppenheimer came out it's already banned in Japan, and what will happen to ban next? It's the Philippines. This movie is not worth it, I hope it flopped the box office."
"My husband and I watched this movie last night and it could not be any better. Right from the opening scene, the movie captivated us with its breathtaking cinematography and mesmerizing soundtrack, which heightened the emotional depth of each moment. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of exceptional, as he brilliantly conveyed the inner conflict and moral dilemmas faced by the scientist during his involvement in the Manhattan Project.The screenplay was intelligently crafted, seamlessly blending historical accuracy with moments of artistic liberty, resulting in a gripping narrative that kept us on the edge of our seats throughout. The film not only explored the scientific aspect of Oppenheimer's work but also delved into his personal life and the profound impact his choices had on the world."
"Cillian Murphy was not an ordinary actor, he was a robot controlled by Chris to show the performance and personality in this way. At a moment I felt that this is the life of the real Cillian Murphy and not acting. I expect the Oscars to be settled for Killian. To be the highest rated movie in history. The film's shortcomings are few, including the way in narrating the events that is not considered a defect, because Chris liked to move between the past, present and future frequently. In the end, some people may not like this type of film, and this is normal, but I think that they are less than affecting such creativity. If you want a sentence to describe the movie (creativity at its best)"
"This is the first time writing here and surely is worth it. Watched the movie last night, after running in two places to find a spot, but was well worth it. The way Nolan mastered to give us the life of Oppenheimer, played exceptionally by Merphy, was something extraordinary with all the ups and downs on his life. Also it has made a 3 plus hour movie run so smoothly like i could go for another 3. All the cast was very good, but again Cilian Merphy has outdone himself, the look on his eyes for most of the movie, it's giving me goosebumps even now that am writing this. And of course what can i say about the cinematography! Go watch it in the best screen you could find."
"Just back from a Dolby Screening of Oppenheimer and I thought it was a mind blowing experience and Nolan pulled a rabbit out of the hat with this team. Screenplay and editing made the movie move at a rapid pace despite the movie fundamentally is a dialogue driven drama. Technically its easily one of the best movies made. That includes cinematography, editing, sound mixing and visual effects.Speaking of performances Cillian is the MVP and he carries this dramatic endeavor brilliantly. I am hoping he wins the Best Actor award next year. Downey was the other one who was absolutely brilliant as a scheming senator. Rest of the cast were all good but did not stand out that much. Blunt had one great scene and Pugh did not have much to do. Damon was solid but his character did not stand out.I have to see this again preferably at a 70 mm Imax if I can get a ticket."
"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Need to watch a lot of documentaries to understand and validate what was shown to be honest. Nonetheless this movie certainly will aid the people to develop sympathy for the father of atomic bomb and also make them scared of what's to come next. The cast was brilliant throughout the movie. Robert Downey Jr. Was so good as Lewis Strauss that you will feel the urge to punch his face. Words cant describe how amazing Cillian Murphy's acting was, you really need to see it to judge it. I always thought that we will remember him as Thomas Shelby but now that we have seen him as Robert Oppenheimer you might need to overwrite your memories."
"Best movie of the year by a country mile.... All the aspects of the movie is just great. The story telling, acting, score, screenplay, cinematography,editing... just brilliant. This has to be Nolans magnum opus. Tenet was not so goid.. Dunkirk was great... but this is just way ahead. His directing here is top notch.The movie seamlessly goes through different phases of the story. Cillian Murphy... well i dont have words to describe his performance. S definite oscsr contender. I just hope that this movie gets the reviews and accolades it deserves. It will definitely be an oscar contender. Lets see."
"This is Nolan's magnum opus. A beautiful movie visually; with a haunting, attacking, physical score. The acting is elite, specially Murphy who is at his apex as an actor. There are so many actors in this movie who you've seen elsewhere but have no idea what they're names are - and all of them hit out of the park. I left the movie theater defeated mentally and emotionally. The intentions were to do Barbie later in the day, but after watching this masterpiece I didn't want to do anything but sit and ponder. I must suggest seeing this movie in IMAX to get the full experience. 10/10, 5 stars, all the awards."
"I've never watched a movie where i had to sit down after. I watched the movie with friends and whats crazy too there was no discussing the movie after. Everyone just sat down quietly and let that masterpiece sink in. Watched in in 70 mm and it was amazing. Felt like i was pulled into the story. The cast is elite, the screenplay is gorgeous to look at and the soundtrack fits the movie perfectly. I've read many criticisms about the pace but all i can say is that everyone i saw in the cinema was watching the movie amazed with undivided attention. The ending also was made so elegant that it blew my mind for a second. In conclusion: Oppenheimer is probably the best movie i've ever seen."
"I had an exceptionally delightful day watching a movie by one of the greatest directors of our generation. This film truly captivated me, from the very first scene until the last. I must confess that when the movie concluded, I found myself gazing at the screen, with one thought endlessly repeating in my mind: how remarkably cruel people can be. It left me craving more of this masterful masterpiece. In this movie, Nolan presents the true battle between good and evil in a dramatically captivating way. The music in the film was absolutely outstanding, earning a perfect 10/10 rating. I wish there were more scenes of Jean."
"Made an account just so I can hype up this masterpiece. The movie is a must-watch. Had me hooked from the very beginning. Nolan is an incredible director and even though I understand that some people may have had slightly different expectations, this movie serves incredible atmosphere, character complexity, story progression and depiction of monumental historical events, without any hint of romanticization. The cast was picked perfectly and served amazing acting. Personally I didn't find it too long, in fact it didn't feel like 3h at all. Would strongly recommend watching it in theaters rather than waiting to stream it at home. Also wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not into history at all. No need to be a history buff, but would recommend looking up the some information about the Manhattan Project and everybody's involvement just for a better feel of the plot, though one can watch the movie without any prior knowledge whatsoever. The plot is rounded-up beautifully and it sparks further need for discussion and thinking, without feeling ambiguous."
"This movie... the values it portrays and the history it has combined with the brilliance of C. Nolan, Van Hoytema and the cast put it into the 'must see' section.It showcases the negatives of capitalism and all wars. It brilliantly showcase of what happens to a person whether they're a genius of Oppenheimer's ranks or not, when they have to choose between evils, the only difference being one will be attributed to them while under their control at the same time.The movie's presence today is more than needed, in a time which can be defined by rapid change. Oppenheimer reminds the audience to always thoroughly think about their options while deciding.The film, of high quality, has deep thoughts scattered all through it. A 10 out of 10 class."
"The story was amazing and great acting,directing I'm sure will Oppenheimer to nominees for best actor, best supporting actor,best director,best sound, best cinematography, best picture, my favorite Christopher nolan movie ever , cillian murphy acting was great my rating for Oppenheimer 9.5/10. It's a wonderful experience for my life,one day I will become a director, my idol is Christopher nolan I genuinely believe the movie was done incredibly well but very much slow paced which is why most people dislike the film but I understood everything from beginning to end and the points that were made as well as by the end when Oppenheimer feared of his own creation finally settled in."
"The feel the look of the movie takes you to that time that era of history, the fast paced editing of dialogue scenes makes the movie exciting,even though the movie is very much based upon dialogues , conversations but short lenghth of scenes and fast paced editing takes down all the boredom & movie feels very fast. 3 hours long but time flies. Not 10 because of no action but that is understandable as the movie is a biopic. For the biopic genre also the movie feels very intelligent & brilliant, the screenplay is tightly written & the the non linear timeline makes you to give more attention to the screen as you don't want to loose & left behind. Christopher nolan never disappoints."
"Personally, i think Christopher Nolan is the best director of all time. You have a different experience in each of his movies. The cast is great and this movie was one of my first times seeing Cillian Murphy and he was spectacular to say the least. It felt like every expression had a meaning. His performance will be talked a lot over the years. RDJ stole the show every scene he was in and i wish he got more screen time. Although the movie was dialogue driven every dialogue and every scene was like an action scene courtesy of Nolan. And the music REALLY helped this film given most of the movie was based on dialogues. I'm gonna watch the movie for the second time tomorrow because i couldn't get all the information and couldn't completely understand the film although it was pretty straightforward. There were a lot of stuff to unpack in the movie. I liked it very much and i highly suggest you watch this movie."
"A 3hrs long movie that won't bore you. Brilliant acting by cillian Murphy and all the great actors including blunt,damon etc. Such a wonderful cast. And the timeline and the progression of the movie was so amazing that it left the viewers in awe even till the very last moment. Amazing soundtrack and composition by ludwig. It has to be his perfect soundtrack. Even the last scene of the movie is soo satisfying that it leaves the audience in amazement. Use of black and white film was spot on. It correctly conveyed the subjective perspective of the two sides. Huge respect for nolans craft. Nevertheless, a nude scene in a movie like this was not really needed. Oppies extamarital affairs could have been conveyed without those scenes."
"Its a terribly long movie with a lot of noise, less of a storyline, far fetched from the truth and well its overhyped. Might even win an academy award but would never pay to watch it in theatres, might just watch it on Netflix if im too depressed. Have seen better CGI as well as documentaries on youtube videos. Expected a lot better from Nolan but maybe its the general public that hyped it up. All those people going to visit theatres to see this movie thinking of it as an exciting thrill or something, well you've got another thing coming since it sucks and so does Manyu claiming to be an exciting movie."
"The Best of Christopher Nolan ever Made This Far.I called myself lucky to watch Oppenheimer on IMAX, this movie really satisfied my eyes and ears. Oppenheimer is beyond my expectations for biographical thriller film. And dont forget about the cast, because the cast was awesome and i cant describe the actors acting with my words. People have to watch this movie once in a lifetime on IMAX, and for the people who hasn't watch Oppenheimer. Please study the background of world war 2 ending and Oppenheimer himself. I really enjoyed this movie even though the duration of this film is three hours long."
"Not a fan of the timing, i think the film was a bit long some scenes seemed unnecessary, the music and overall sound design was great though saved some scenes that were a bit long for certain, the framing of shots is a bit repetitive at times but the overall filming is as good as expected, the storytelling was great although a bit less clear near the end but it might just be an impression due to the length. Overall i think the movie was as good as expected, but might not be great if not viewed in a cinema, as it really needs good audio to help stay focused. Good not great, could be better, but still strongly recommend to see it."
"I really can find the right words to describe how beautiful this movie is , for me it's the best movie I've ever seen and the soundtracks are extremely beautiful and it feels like you are living in another universe. What a bloody brilliant film and amazing actors. I never knew the story but I wanted to laugh, cry and shout at the screen. Such a powerful important story that's everyone needs to see and believe me you won't be able to watch any movie after this movie for a while. Nolan is hands down a freaking genius. I literally enjoyed every second, detail, character and soundtrack. This movie hits different."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer delivers an immersive blend of sadness and fear, unfolding the nonlinear narrative of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life. The portrayal of human folly and pursuit of power is chilling. Pacing, sound, and editing create an unparalleled cinematic experience. Cillian Murphy's astonishing performance deserves Oscar. Robert Downey Jr. Shines as his complicated associate. Background knowledge enhances the film's impact. A future classic with a powerful historic message; challenges the audience to contemplate the consequences of human actions; a must-see for all film lovers."
"This is the culmination of everything Christopher Nolan has directed. It's perfect. Everything, from the beginning to the ending. Going into this movie I expected a depressing film but it was way more depressed then I had thought. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. The score is phenomenal, the sound design is exhilarating, the set design is incredible, the performances are BEYOND AMAZING. This movie will 100% dominate in the awards season. I can guarantee that Cillian Murphy will take home best actor with Robert Downey Jr taking home the best supporting actor. This is a master class in cinema and needs to be seen on the biggest screen imaginable."
"The film is very heavy, but a masterpiece. Personally, the experience I had with the film, I do not think it will be repeated, because it is so great, the sound, the great photography, the impressive embodiment of the actors, and the scene of the bombing that is difficult to forget. A masterpiece from Nolan's masterpieces, one of the best biographical films in history because it was presented in a distinctive way by Nolan with his special touches. Personally, I will watch the movie two or three times in the cinema. And my personal rating for the movie is 10/10. I recommend watching the movie in the cinema, specifically in the IMAX, to live the best possible cinematic experience."
"Just had the most INCREDIBLE movie in years! Mesmerized by the visuals, and the SOUNDTRACK? It had my heart pounding the whole time! And let's talk about Cillian Murphy's eyes. Deserve an Oscar all on their own! Chris Nolan's brilliance shines through again! This is one of the best movies you will ever watch. Cillian absolutely steals the show. I have never imagined Robert Downey Jr. Giving such an immaculate performance. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and all other supporting casts did an incredible job. A huge thanks to Chris and the incredible cast & crew for giving us this unbelievable cinematic experience."
"Oppenheimer was a great and very well crafted historical interpretation from Chris Nolan. Even as someone who doesn't know the ins and outs of this particular era of history, this movie served as a great look into the past. I had been waiting to see this movie for months ever since I heard it was going to be released in July. I think that with other movies that are highly anticipated sometimes they let you down even if they aren't that bad, it's just because they weren't perfect. In this case the anticipation was not a problem and after the movie I can wholeheartedly say this is one of if not the best movie I've ever seen, not only in theatres but ever.Cinematography: 10/10
Acting: 10/10
Everything else 10/10."
"I've heard that a big deterrent to watch this movie is it's 3 hour run time, however, I believe that those 3 hours make up one of the most important films in cinema history. Oppenheimer is a hard-to-swallow biopic on one of mankind's most important men to ever live, and every second of this film is nothing short of accurate history (from big factual sources like the book ""American Prometheus"" which in itself is the biggest inspiration for this film) combined with Christopher Nolan's remarkable story telling. This is a movie you do NOT want to miss. Also, don't forget to watch it on its intended format (70mm or IMAX)"
"This might not come as a shock when reading the headline, but it truly is one of the greatest movies I've seen since Forest Gump or Pulp fiction.I've never experienced ANYTHING. LIKE. THIS. In a very long time. Yes, three hours may seem long, but it surely wasn't a waste of time at any point in the movie, the way they filmed it, how it was written, all the actors as well as the roles they got just fit together in a great harmony and beauty.I just want to say how great full I am to have gotten the honour to see this masterpiece. It was breathtaking and a truly remarkable and astonishing experience. I believe this may not be an informative review, but I hope it came to use for someone to get the urge to go see this masterpiece of a movie and production."
"I mean, why the hell are you even on this app to check the ratings of this movie? If you're a movie freak, you shouldn't even doubt Christopher Nolan's work here. About which he said is the whole struggle of his life. And, and look at the GODDAMN cast ffs, what else do u want?? If u have watched any of CN's movies u should know how great this movie is going to be!!!! I'm flabbergasted at guy's' audacity like f u for god's sake. And please note that this is going to be a movie that changes ur perspective and standard for the movies u watch after it. With all of that said, pardon my language. And oh I haven't watched the movie yet but i know its gonna be awesome. Thanks for tuning in. Bye."
"Oppenheimer is not a typical Nolan films like Inception or Interstellar. It is a three hour long biographical thriller film which was running like a fast moving car. As an IR student i've found it very relatable but thats not the case with most of the Indian audience. This movie has lot of characters like Strauss, J Hoover, Roosevelt, Kennedy and many more American scientists. You should have fair idea about their role in American history then only you could relate it better. First half was very much setting up the plot of the film which revolves around Oppenheimer's Journey. But the second half right from the ""Trinity test"" to the mystery of the end was an absolute amazing. The background score was tense and will held you till the end of the movie. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey have given their career best performance. Eventually, all i can say it is more of ""Dunkirk"" kind of film rather than Dark Knight or Interstellar. If you love watching serious cinema then it is a must watch movie, you will surely enjoy it."
"Oppenheimer is a 3-hour movie that, in contrast to Nolan's more recent sci-fi movies, demonstrates his mastery of the Biopic/Drama genre. The movie moves quickly while tackling significant themes and giving a thorough character analysis of our culture. It was one of the most frightening scenes in recent memory, making theatergoers uneasy and serving as a reminder of the full power of the film experience. With a remarkable cinematic achievement and a poignant reminder that cinema is still alive, Oppenheimer is a winner on all counts. I have already seen the movie once and intend to go back to the theater at least a few more times in the near future. It is highly recommended for everyone."
"Fantastic movie. This is the best movie I have watched in a LONG time! We have always know how great Nolan is as a filmmaker but this makes him for me the best filmmaker ever. This is one of his best work yet, and you could argue that it is the best movie ever. The acting and story telling was perfect. Nolan and Murphy did a good job in portraying Dr. Oppenheimer as a character and personality. All the other actors did a fantastic job as well as their role I could see that all of the actors knew what they were doing. We could really see that It had some of the best cinematography I have ever seen and it was well put together. The movie is 3 hours long but you can barely even fell the length of the movie."
"Yes I'm giving this a 7 for its achievements with the whole production, acting, cinematography, score and above all the difficult biopic choice. It is an interesting story and I am a huge history fan. Which helped a lot with heaps of the other side characters.The run-time was not an issue for me .I will however say I want more vintage Nolan next. He's tried two movies in this historical genre Dunkirk which I don't rate at all and now Oppenheimer which I feel is a huge redemption.Tenet was far too confusing and average compared to other Nolan epics. You've done well Nolan I salute you, it's time to go back to what you do best."
"Oppenheimer from which I had expectations and waited for so long was more a documentary. 1/3rd black and white 1/3rd historical facts and 1/3rd indecipherable wannabe movie making trying to give it a drama masterpiece look. Movie lovers think it was a documentary, documentary lovers think it was a movie. In my opinion total hodgepodge to confuse but would definitely break the bank. Acting was weak, even though resemblances matter but poor acting would only earn and not be long lasting as a movie to be reckoned with. In short a documovie would be the right word instead of entertainment. A solid 3/10 from me."
"As expected A Nolan Masterpiece... Cillian Murphy and RDJ deserve an Oscar for this... People with a science background can relate better. Movie of the decade already...Minute details are taken care of. Like the fact that light travels way faster than sound...A Brief description of the movie:
During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history."
This is one of the greatest films i've watched in a while. Murphy was perfect for his role and another fantastic job by Christopher Nolan. I remember watching the trailer and anticipating this movie more than anything. This movie lived up to my expectations and then some. The music was really good and kept the movie interesting and it felt like i was truly inside of Oppenheimer's mind. The ending scene was incredible and and the visuals of this movie blew me away. It is a bit loud sometimes but that's to come as expected when creating a movie about bombs. If you enjoy movies that are at a slower pace and require a lot of thought and attention then this movie is definitely for you.
"In an age where cinema is dying thanks to multiple releases of consumable products that taste/feel the same this was the movie I personally needed and the entire movie Industry needed as well. All actors did a phenomenal job, Cillian Murphy was simply fantastic, Robert Downy Jr. Was so versatile and the entire supporting cast delivered their best and it was impactful. The long 3 hour runtime didn't feel long at all in fact it had me hooked from the start till the end, there was no scene that was boring or dragged out. Christopher Nolan proving once again that he is one of the best in this age, this may be his best work yet.This movie deserves all the praise that it's getting."
"Not gonna say it was a bad movie. But it was average at best. Despite the amazing acting, the movie falls short in every other aspect. The short scenes and continuous cutting and shifting from past to future where some scenes didn't serve any purpose or help to understand in fact it makes you more lost alongside the unnecessary characters. All of the previous added the 40-50 extra minutes that made it a boring film. Disappointed mainly because of the hype around it. But honestly a movie mainly about ""bombs"" had 1 bomb scene, and 90% was just meetings of people grilling each other with load music in the background."
Perfectly fine with me and I hope that it will be a good one for me some time they will be a written one of them has different purpose and shows different view of the map and the workplace and the workplace to the games and this addiction slowly interrupts the personality of this human being and the workplace and the workplace to the games and this addiction slowly interrupts the personality of this human being and the workplace and the workplace to the games and this addiction slowly interrupts the personality of this human being and the workplace and the workplace to the games and this addiction.
Its the beat movie that i have watched in a while the acting the cast wow people who understand movies will know how good this movie was done cilan the actor whi played oppeenhaimer deserves oscar for his roll Hi's acting was priceless just beautiful You fell like your experiencening the movie with the actors in ever way and shows you how the bomb really changed the word einsten was a beautiful touch to the movie also i hope people understand how a good of a jop they did in this movie and understand how nolan and cilan give it there all in this movies they definitely deserve unaward for this movie..
"What a splendid movie the whole 3 hours i watched it never felt like going out of the theatre the atmosphere created by the movie was so majestic..Loved cillians acting n RDJs, and ofcourse Christopher nolan the brilliant director behind all this .. The way the movie portrayed Oppenheimers character is just wonderful the making of atomic bomb the consequences he imagined after wards and the fear of having bloods in his hands the corrupt system of being jealous of another's work and forcing to work into it more false accusations on Oppenheimer by lewis strauus..you won't regret watching this movie."
"This movie captivated me from the beginning. Stunning visuals mixed with the best acting I've seen in years along with a phenomenal soundtrack. This is a biopic so if you're expecting action and lots of explosions this isn't the movie for you. It's about a man and his discovery not about the bomb itself. A refreshing turn from the pointless action movie of todays. This movie has meaning and depth, pulling you in and not letting you go until the very end. The emotion you feel through the screen is palpable and it was one of the best movies I have seen in years. Don't wait to see this movie at home, see it in cinema, you won't regret it."
"Chris Nolan never stops surprising me with his movies, this is a masterpiece and his first movie ever made based on a true story, with an amazing cast, production, photography and acting, everyone here did an awesome acting.Interstellar became my favorite movie not just from Nolan's but among every other directors but Oppenheimer for some reason made me feel like I wasn't even watching a movie but actually like if I was watching the story in real life as if I was IN THE MOVIE, it really sucked me in, and just like said in an interview, don't try to understand my movies, just feel them, and indeed I sure felt it."
"Christopher Nolan's latest film, Oppenheimer, is an absolute triumph of storytelling and visual artistry. The IMAX experience elevated the already mesmerizing narrative to a whole new level! 🌌Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the lead character is nothing short of astonishing. He embodies the role with such depth and nuance that an Oscar nod seems inevitable! 🏆The film's thought-provoking themes and powerful messages left me wishing I could assemble all the world leaders in one giant IMAX theater to share this experience together. #FoodForThought #NolanMagicIf you haven't seen Oppenheimer yet, you're missing out on a true cinematic gem. Prepare to be spellbound and awestruck!"
"Pretty long film no doubt, But I had expectations because we were told by the cast and the director Christopher Nolan during the interviews, that the audience would be able to experience what destructive power an atomic bomb has just like what we can see for an explosion in Nuclear reactor visually in the show by HBO, Chernobyl.Disappointed, that nothing was shown visually, I couldn't connect with the guilt Oppenheimer had when he said, ""he feels blood on his hand"". Nevertheless, it is just a fulfilling documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer depicted in the film, don't expect anything more."
"Have no words.its just incredible.the ending just scary and beautiful at the same time. I have nothing to to say it's just incredible much incredible.During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history.This is exactly the Christopher Nolan relieved the history.The famous speech of openheimer ""IAM become death the destroyer of worlds"". Is in this film as well."
"This film is excellent all the way around. I always liked Nolan's work, but this one cemented me as viewing him as a great filmmaker period, and not just a great blockbuster filmmaker. The script is extremely sharp and the stand out performance is Cillian Murphy who really puts his heart into the role. It does not feel like 3 hours and even though I knew a lot of the story, it was still very engaging and enjoyable. This one honestly rivals Memento and The Dark Knight for me as Nolan's greatest achievement. I would say it's even better than the Batman trilogy because the script is so much sharper. Don't walk, run to see this one in theaters!"
"This movie is truly magnificent. All of Nolan's decisions are somewhat changing the rules of cinema and going around them. The acting is brilliant from all sides. Murphy is one of the best actors and will be truly appreciated after this role. Also, I truly love the fact that there is no CGI in this movie. It makes every explosion or metaphor for Oppenheimer's thoughts even more strong than if they were computer generated. Also the montage of the film is truly marvelous and innovative. The film is constructed in such way that it catches the audience's attention and it doesn't let go. For sure, this is one for the future generations!"
"Kantara, KGF PART 1-2 , PUSPA, Created for mass ....but no one can match Christopher Nolan' Directorial Epic 'Oppenheimer' ......Some say it's boring and too lengthy.... But if you sit back and think it as a Biopic and the struggles which Oppenheimer had in his life you will realise the film made full justice to his character and his story.....apart from controversial statement of bringing Bhagwat Gita phrase ....the film has done no wrong .....Brilliant Story Telling ....
Yes the first half was long and Boring but it had to be ........
2nd half was so fast paced and answers lot of questions.......Wait for last 20 seconds it will create goosebumps......I give 9/10 for this Epic ......"
"After 2 and a half hours, you realize that it all revolves around the conflict between Oppenheimer and Strauss, who originally hired him to create the Atom Bomb. Strauss later tried to undermine him simply because he didn't want to give Oppenheimer so much credit. Other topics such as competition with the Nazis, how the bomb was made, Oppenheimer's relationship with Eisenstein, and his love life are only briefly touched upon. There is a continuous musical score accompanied by overwhelming sound effects to alleviate the boredom. You are relieved when things become slightly clearer at the end what is the focus of the movie and especially that the film is finely over."
"No action, just talking heads and overly loud background music. Surprise surprise maybe a bomb goes off. Better of watching old videos about the MP on the Smithsonian website. Nakedness thrown in for no good purpose.Triumph of marketing. Why waste 3 hours on this when you could watch Babylon again where nakedness actually meaningful to the film.Weird graphics depicting quantum mechanics that adds nothing.Sequencing early, middle and late events -black and white -colour- back and forwards- totally doesn't add anything, except confusion.No sure its worth any nominations but I'm guessing it will get some sadly."
"I attended Friday afternoon matinee on opening day. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the crowd. I took notice this movie was mostly sold out for all showings. It encouraged me to see people seeking out intelligent ""entertainment. ""This is a very accurate portrayal of Mr. Oppenheimer. A well scripted an researched historical account of his personal and professional life. It's a long movie, but the intricacies of the story require the time to develop. I personally appreciated the moral and social issues and conflicts that were addressed as they related to the political climate and his own personal life."
"Definitely being my favorite 3 hours this year, this film brings you an unexpected visual feast. You cannot miss a second, enormous details are easily missed away. This film didn't only show the creation of the nuclear bomb, it literally shows the life and tragedy of Robert Oppenheimer, how he encounters risking DESTROYING THE WORLD enable to save it.The acting of the cast is way above expectations, like Murphy, how he grabbed our heart and eyes into this film. Stating not to watch it, but to feel through the theme and parts of the story, Oppenheimer is a great example, starring good cast with good actings."
"I have never written a review on this site, nor had I planned to until I sat down and watched Oppenheimer. I was floored by its effortless genius and masterful writing. The movie takes the viewer on a turbulent, frankly disturbing ride, that leaves you jostled, depressed, and stunned. A cinematic experience that goes unmatched. A cinematic experience that I hope is not overlooked by the often ignorant Oscars. The film easily cements itself as Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. The directors usual tricks that often make his films at times fall flat, work wonders here. From the entirely practical effects to dialogue overload that in his other films feel hollow only fuel the fire that is Oppenheimer. Techniques that make me overjoyed that Nolan was the director to make this movie and not someone else. If you have not seen it, I urge you. Yes, it is long, and yes, it is not an action filled blockbuster, but it is something better. A movie that tells a story that changes the way the viewer perceives the world we live in. Because isn't that what art is supposed to do."
"This is the another amazing movie from nolan's movie and he complete his collection with making these movies!!!!!!!! This is historic movie from nolan and we enjoy from his real charactristic and i really need to see a real WWII from him, his way need to be near reality.It seems it needs oscar this year and we nolans' fans will support this action for nominate in any movie, cilien murphy is the best actress for doing his act in nolans movie and nolan make any actress great for evey decade, we need to see his future movie to surprise us it would be masterpiece for nolans fans we love him and his movies......"
"I enjoyed this film completely. I think it was fantastic. I can see why CGI wasn't used for the bomb, because the actual explosion wasn't the main focus in the film. Then again it was.... The acting was top notch and the director did a terrific job. I knew very little about Oppenheimer before this movie. Just an all around impressive film. Yes it's 3 hrs, but honestly what adult can't sit and watch a film this good for few a few hrs. It's Not like they aren't sitting around somewhere else on there butt. I found myself the next day looking up things about Oppenheimer on my phone and watching documentaries about his life. I honestly might go see it again."
"One of the best cinematic experiences of all time. Everything from acting to directing to the cinematography is really really good. It challenges you as a person and it leaves you feeling an emptiness inside yourself. Robert Downey Jr was outstanding and his monologue at the end is too good. Cillian Murphy was excellent as always and Emily Blunt as well. The trinity test sequence is absolutely phenomenal while obeying the laws of physics of the speed of sound and light. When you hear Oppenheimer's iconic quote ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"" it will give you goosebumps and you will enjoy that moment. Overall a great cinematic watch. I definitely reccomend watching it in theatres."
"A very emotional and intense movie. The lead up to the bomb was really captivating & i really loved the decisions they made surrounding the bomb detonation. The movie is stacked with star studded cast with great performances all around, particularly cillian & RDJ. Whilst I found the first hour to be a little slow, it really did pick up from there on. I can understand why some people may find this boring as its dialogue heavy and very little action but i thoroughly enjoyed it and knew what to expect going in. I think its worth knowing that the movie is about the story of his life as many may be misguided on what the movie is about."
"I fed into all of the hype and was extremely excited to watch this film. I will never get these 3 hours of my life back. In my opinion there was only one good scene and that was the explosion. The rest of the film is a convoluted mess with all the characters shaping up to be completely uninteresting(except for Oppenheimer himself) The acting was rather good but it doesn't matter when the characters are uninteresting. I've seen many movies and I think this takes the cake for the movie that was the least gripping/entertaining. How can you be expected to pay attention to a 3 hour dialogue slog of a movie when you can barely hear the actors talking? I don't think it was a theatre issue but if it was I apologize. The film is only good for about 10 mins, 1/10 should have seen Barbie."
"As always, Christopher Nolan never disappoint me, all his movie was amazing. It's the first time I've watched a Biography movie, and I really liked it, and I'm going to watch it again.The visual and sound effect was amazing and very enjoy to watch.Cillian Murphy also was amazing in this role, and I was sure before I watch the movie, That Cillian Murphy will be a great actor in this role, and definitely will take the Oscar this year, just by watching the trailer, I watched the movie with my friends, and none of them loved and watched the movie to the end, except me.I know this movie not for everyone, it's for the people who admire the directing, the acting, and the cinematography."
Cillian Murphy has now had his greatest performance of his career if he does not win best actor at the Oscar's something is very wrong in my opinion. And this movie is going to be hard to beet for me as the movie of the year. The story was very good I did not even feel that 3 hour run time at all. No spoilers but the parallel from world War 3 politics to today's political climate is astounding the sound mix of the movie was great the direction of the movie was Oscar worthy Robert Downey Jr. Was fantastic his best performance of his career as well the score of the movie was great this is very intense in places over all I loved it.
"""Oppenheimer"" has left an lasting impression on me, a feat only a handful of movies have ever accomplished. Through Nolan's exceptional storytelling and artistic abilities, this film presented history and life from fresh perspectives, which captured my attention from the opening scene to the final credits. I just sat there while the credits rolled in the end, in silence feeling a sense of the horror Oppenheimer must have felt at his accomplishment. I foresee this film having a significant influence on audiences all over the world. Prior to watching this movie, I had little knowledge of Oppenheimer. However, it has given me a fascination and hunger to learn more about him and the stories told in the movie. Oppenheimer and his associates set into motion a series of irreversible events that have significantly shaped our world. His choices and their consequences remind us of the profound impact an individual's life can have on history."
"It's a fantastic movie with such a perfect combination of artist and the director. In the end couldn't figure out if anything should have been deleted or added. It's so well balanced, it's definitely not a movie for everyone. Don't expect any drama or action sequences. It's a story about a guy a scientist who didn't fall into something and has superpowers. His just a scientist who created something.it's for war nerds or history nerds like me who watch history channel for hours or still get fascinated by WW documentary and stories. There's are so many lives involved, so many people who never got a chance to tell there story. Many people would have lived without knowing about this guy. It's just a very beautiful movie."
"I was highly anticipating this movie since the trailer dropped earlier this year since I was a big fan of Nolan's Dunkirk. Going in, I was scared that this movie wasn't going to live up to my expectation but by the end I could say that it has surpassed it. The visuals were truly spectacular, the score was fantastic, cinematography even more so. Cillian Murphy's acting was very good as J. Robert Oppenheimer. I felt that he encapsulates the character of Oppenheimer very authentically and makes him a very complicated figure that we could all sympathise with despite being the father of one of the most destructive weapons that humanity has ever created. All of that couldn't have been done without Murphy's acting. The side characters were also pretty well played by their respective actors with my favourites being Lewis Strauss played by Robert Downey Jr. And Albert Einstein by Tom Conti. All of this combined making the movie one of the most engaging that I have seen for quite some time in theatres. 10/10."
"Being a huge Nolan fan(Interstellar is my favourite movie of all time) I had so high expectations going in the cinema for this one...oh boy was I disappointed! It was partly my fault,having listened to all the praise..masterpiece here..best biopic movie ever there..all the hype was created. For what? For a movie that just feels like a series of trailers with the music and the score,instead of being complimentary to the film and create such an important vibe throughout all Nolan film ,it ended being so distracting..always like keeping you on the edge of your seat like something important will happen. But it never does,it is just endless boring,complicated and hard to follow dialogue after dialogue. There are so many characters in the movie that you just do not care for..I didnt care what hapoens to Oppenheimer himself,Emily Blunt..Robert Downey jr.... Sure,they are great actors,but there is nothing to root for the characters they play.."
"This was one of the most transcendent, intellectually harrowing and emotionally horrifying experiences I've ever had. Not at the movies, EVER. I believe this is by far Nolan's most emotional piece (yes, I'd put this above interstellar) and as someone who needs no introduction in terms of cerebral movies, it was absolutely incredible for that to be paired with a sense of visceral character explorations. And make no mistake, this movie will haunt you. And terrify you. I'm the biggest horror nut around, having seen Jaws before I turned 8, and from then, the shining, Blair witch, Halloween, terrifier, NONE of them scared me like this. This movie scared me so much I started crying and shaking in my seat."
"I've read so many books, watched so many movies, listened so many songs about the Herosima and Nagasaki incident. But for the first time ever my eyes were wet when that bombing part came in and also after finishing this film. I really felt for the poor japanese, I really felt the same guilt that Oppenheimer felt. Also, the timing cycle, the shifts, twists and turns of telling the life story of him(Oppenheimer) was brilliant. That's the success of the director and the whole team. Moreover, this film is worth watching. Although it's more than 180 minutes, I don't think anybody will feel bored. It also contains a great message for the world leaders and a warning sign for the coming future. At last, I think this is one of the most important films of the twenty first century."
"Awesome, NOLAN .. THANKS FOR THIS. WE REMEMBER THIS. Your cinematic brilliance . 1st half at some parts while charcters discussing little boring feeling i felt but except that genius of a cinema. Watched first time your film in theatre it's great . Thanks .. CILLIAN MURPHY , EMILY BLUNT, ROBERT DOWNEY JR. , RAMI MALEK ACTING AWESOME. WATCHED IT HERE IN #NMAX THEATRE IN MY HOMETOWN #ANANTAPURAM WHICH IS A DISTRICT IN #ANDHRAPRADESH IN #INDIA. I ENJOYED. THANKS. 2ND HALF 5/5. FIRST HALF 3/5. THIS IS HOW WE INDIANS WATCH A FILM .OVERALL 8/10. THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE YOUR FILM. THANKS TO EVERYBODY."
"This. Will. Win. Everything. Under. The. Sun. Whether all the credit goes to Cillian Murphy's brillance or to Nolan for tapping Cillian, we may never know. But both combine for something that will go unmatched for a long time. An honest biopic about Robert Oppenheimer that doesn't provide any answers because there are no easy answers. Instead, it lends to the audience a masterwork of a story worth pondering over & over. This goes above Nolan's past best works in Dunkirk and Inception, not only due to the refined wizardry of Nolan's genius but also to the nature of what the film sets out to explore -- that momentous juncture in human history when we couldn't mathmatically rule out that we, as humanity, could destroy ourselves in the very attempt to save ourselves--with all of our human complexicites webbed throughout."
"Good CGI on nuclear explosions. Jumps around rather than a linear presentation. It would be hard to sit through another look. Once and done. We saw it in IMAX which was nice. The Lewis Strauss portrayal reminds me of the current Democrat Party.The other part of the Strauss legacy is overwhelmed by his machinations against Oppenheim.Robert Downey Jr. Played the role so well one can only look down on any positive contributions Lewis Strauss did before or after what he did to Oppenheimer. I hope people take what he did to Oppenheimer as a warning on how the search for absolute power as Lord Acton the British historian coined "" Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely""See the movie if evil political intrigue does not raise your blood pressure too high."
"In my opinion, the film Oppenheimer is one of the best films in the history of the film industry. I've never felt an explosion in a film as much as I did in Oppenheimer. In my cinema I could literally feel the pressure wave. In addition, the plot of the film was written and filmed absolutely perfectly. You were emotionally taken a lot and the events were presented in great detail and accurately. For this reason, I cannot understand many of the criteria, for example. Either you don't have patience because the film is so long or many don't understand it because they don't have the necessary intelligence to be able to understand the film, because otherwise you would give the film at least a 9.0. As for the acting, I can only say that it was an absolute champion performance by everyone. I also take my hat off to the absolutely legendary execution and direction of Nolan and the film's producers. Thank you for letting me sit in such a masterpiece."
"Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer,' deserves all the praise that it gets. It's a Nolan film and you get more than what you had paid for. The movie despite its 3 hour runtime doesn't fail to keep me engaged, however if you are the typical average audience then I can see how you would manage to be bored throughout the movie. The movie was super realistic and makes me appreciate Cillian Murphy as an actor. I have to say - the cast is wonderful and Nolan really knows how to put them to work. Throughout the film there were times I would get tremendously sweaty, so nervous that I would firmly grasp the side of my seat. The movie is a masterpiece and the best bibliographical movie I've ever seen."
"Oppenheimer is worth the hype especially if you watch it in IMAX. It's the best biopic to date, Nolan really shows his excellent interpretation through his direction and all supporting actors truly deliver. In true Nolan fashion his thought are dispersed in a way where in the end it leaves you satisfied as it is cohesive and thought provoking. His interpretation of the character is amazing. The way he combines physics, philosophy and politics is mesmerising.RDJ character Lewis Strauss is a standout in my opinion, a man who is conservative. Whereas, J Robert Oppenheimer is a man who is depicted as morally conflicted and the emotions of the character are excellent displayed by Murphy.LET NOLAN COOK."
"""Oppenheimer"" is an exceptional cinematic experience that exceeded all my expectations. The plot is captivating, filled with suspense and unexpected twists that keep the audience engaged. The characters are well-developed, and the performances are phenomenal, drawing viewers into their emotional journey. The direction, cinematography, and musical score all contribute to a visually stunning and emotionally resonant film. While a few minor pacing issues exist, they hardly detract from the overall brilliance of ""Oppenheimer."" It's a must-watch for any film enthusiast, earning my enthusiastic rating of 9/10. Bravo to the cast and crew for creating such a profound and memorable movie."
I feel now Openheimer is more popular than Albert Einstein after this movie and everyone knows. Great movie best screenplay another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Apparently scientific part in the movie was very small. They could have added more how they built the bomb. What is heavy waters. I found that in the scene where Openheimer sitting in his house with his wife on a dining table there is an Ethernet port or analog telephone port in the back wall. I observed this 2 times in the movie. I am sure that there was no ethernet and phone ports. I am writing it here because I could not find anywhere to report. Let me know if you feel the same.
"This could easily be Nolans best work yet or ever. The only nit pick I have is the audio mixing with music and dialogue that Nolan has struggled with in his past couple movies, is still a slight problem here. Other than that, the casting (Cillian and RDJ are oscar bound), epic music, dialogue, cinematography, storytelling is all a masterpiece. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT THE ATOMIC BOMB. ITS ABOUT OPPENHEIMER. Nolan tells the story of oppenheimers insane life pre, post and during the war to perfection and Cillian Murphy makes you feel everything he went through along the way. At no point did I feel like the movie was dragging because it has a breakneck pace that could be tiring but it keeps you glued to the screen. If you don't give yourself the chance to see this movie in theaters (IMAX preferably), you are robbing yourself of an opportunity to see one of the most important movies in recent memory."
"I love Christopher Nolan, Inception might be my favorite movie of all time. But honestly this was just kinda boring and I wasn't super interested in the story. My roommate loved it but I miss when Nolan was doing more interesting fiction.There was far less of the after effects of the bombing shown than I expected, and I was overall disappointed with how low budget this film seemed. I miss the action or at least interest and supernatural intensity and wonder Nolan has accomplished alongside the intellectual rollercoaster in his 2010's films. This was just kind of a documentary, gave me similar vibes to that McDonald's Founder film or First Man, though without any of the action First Man had. Not that I can't appreciate a movie without action, that's just something I miss how Nolan does, and was overall just bored with this movie."
"This film falls well short of a perfect 10. Undoubtedly, it boasts commendable acting, a decent soundtrack, and an intriguing subject. Yet, regrettably, it devolves into a borefest, burdened by an overtly complicated plot. The story's conclusion seems within reach, but it cunningly extends for another hour, prolonging the viewer's endurance. While the performances shine, the movie's charm wears thin amidst the convoluted narrative. Honest enjoyment gets clouded by an unnecessary length, leaving one longing for a more concise, satisfying experience. In essence, it has potential, but its shortcomings overshadow its strengths."
"Can't say much. You get immersed in the world and atmosphere Christopher Nolan builds, and with the ending this film leaves a deep impact on you. Words fall short for Nolan's brilliance, ""masterpiece"" would be an understatement. To me it's Nolan's best film, even better than Interstellar. It isn't just about the atom bomb. It's a deep dive within its creator's character and life. It is Nolan's most emotional and impactful film. He has covered so many aspects and genres of life in one biopic. All the actors have done absolutely top level acting, especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr who shine in their roles. This is probably the best biopic we have seen in a long time!"
"Movie is great and all thanks to Christopher Nolan but the plot is very confusing and the pacing isn't in chronological order. The characters are also very confusing because of how plentiful they are. I had to do some research after watching the movie so that I could fully understand it, but I still can't connect the characters and I am missing a big part of the storyline.On the positive side, the explosions are great, the quality and everything is superb and it's one of the best movies I have seen in a minute. Definitely worth watching if you got 3 hours to spare. Might be a long movie and gets boring at times but you won't regret it."
"One of the best films in a long time I can't praise it enough it describes history beautifully. Honestly going to the cinema was an unbelievable experience even when you realize that no computer effects were used in the film so it's really incredible. The cast is so well cast and the resemblance to real actors is just amazing. Cillian Murphy should deserve an award for this film because he played the role so well , I hope fiom will be properly appreciated . The explosion scene was one of the best I've ever seen the silence and the look I can't get enough of it , More films like this !😉😉😉😉😉T."
"It discusses important questions that float in our heads , or those who wonder about how did the world get to this point
It explains how it happened how humanity is it's own first enemy , if it's curiosity, rise to power or whatever it's , if we don't consider what's coming we will unleash destruction , devastation
the acting on of each an every actor is almost the best in each of their careers
they are committed and emerged and will take you inside Oppenheimer's head and the chaotic story about science vs politics vs just being decent human beings
the soundtrack and sound effects are immersive ,you are not just travel there , you experience what's in the character's head and the pressure and how they see things
and the final quote , it's there to stay and defines the stage we are at as human race."
"Christopher Nolan delivered on essentially every front with Oppenheimer. This film was able to encapsulate the complexity and moral web of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life. Right away, with the opening scene, this film instills in you the seriosity with which it should be taken. Actors Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Delivered particularly stellar performances, though across the board, this film's acting was incredible. The soundtrack of Oppenheimer deserves equal praise, and though the plot can be slow at points, it makes sense why. This is not a film to be rushed. Amongst his other films, this movie stands above all of them, except for, perhaps, Interstellar."
"Christopher Nolan's incessant use of suspenseful music is a crutch heavily leaned on in Oppenheimer. It seems as though the filmaker believes that bombarding the audience with intense musical cues will create an illusion of tension and excitement. However it becomes evident that the music is attempting to compensate for what is simply a very boring story line!Its an uninspired plot, which struggles to maintain even the faintest glimmer of interest. The runtime feels painfully stretched, leading to an inexplicable endurance test for viewers. I found myself counting the minutes until the credits mercifully rolled!!!"
"I had great expectations when I went to the movie. When I left the movie, all my expectations were met. We can say that it is nolan's best movie.Murpy once again performed a great acting and the film, albeit silently, explained the flood that broke inside Oppenheimer very well. The fact that the cast is perfect, it is in different dates, and most importantly, when it is colored, the black and white screen from the eyes of Oppenheimer and the third person view, it is also wonderfully processed.Let's come to the bad side, the person who wants to watch this movie can definitely watch it in a cinema with Imax, I think there will be no same effect in a place without Imax."
"This movie was absolutely breathtaking. I don't typically like history movies all that much but the perfect level of action, excitement. This movie had me literally at the edge of my seat. Murphy played this roll so beyond well and I am not surprised, he is the only reason I watched this and man did he deliver. If he doesn't win an award for this movie I'll start a riot. Robert was incredible, I was not expecting for such a twist and such a debate. The only downside was Florence's nude scenes, honestly they were unnecessary, I could have watched this movie perfectly fine without seeing someone's chest or bare ass."
"I went to the cinema without hope, i saw the trailer 1 week before and i felt a weird feeling because i was waiting another movie. Decided to see the movie because is directed by Cristopher Nolan and i love his movies never dissapointed me (Except Dunkerke).When i finally see de movie i couldn´t stop smiling and asking me what i saw. I went with my brother and my friend, we were in suprised with this movie. The actuation specially of Murphy was absolutly brilliant for ours more than Robert Downey Jr.Conclusion: Nolan has a crazy but smart brain and it´s impossible to let your down (Except with Dunkerke movie).Congratulations Cristopher Nolan."
"Everything in this film was amazing. I watched this film in 70mm IMAX and loved every single second of it. My opinion may be biased because I love Christopher Nolan's work as well as the work of many of the actors in this film. It is very historically accurate, people complain about sound in Nolan films but I don't have a single complaint about the sound for this one. The way this film is structured may confuse many people, there are a lot of cuts in the beginning and end but it is not made too difficult to understand. I watched this with a friend that had nearly no knowledge of Oppenheimer other than his greatest achievement of course and he understood basically everything in this film. The entire cast did a brilliant job, especially Cillian Murphy. It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr. Actually push himself and reaffirm his talent. I cannot recommend this film enough to anyone. Everything is done perfectly."
The film is extremly good. Although the movie is 3 hours long you won't get bored. The story is told in a great way and the actors are perfectly choosen. Of course the performance of the actors were also incredibile. The countryside was also well choosen. The camera movement and the switches between black and white and colour makes the movie way more exciting and realistic. Also the clean and thoughtful cuts let the film be very philosophic. Honestly at the end you are mindblown and it all makes sense. Because the film is so philosophic you have to think about it after the film ended. All in all a great movie.
"It's a great Christopher Nolan movie and definitely one of if not my favorite movie. However it's not a movie made for everyone. You need to have a good attention span and you have to be interested in it. Even I have to still comprehend it and overthink about it. I saw alot of people who say it is a boring movie and I think the reason is they didn't understand many parts. I think another reason is many people never watched a biography movie and only expect movies where there is a happy ending. Overall if you think you can watch a 3 hour masterpiece that is literally a biography, then watch it."
"It is unfair to write a review and evaluation of Oppenheimer's film, it is like someone coming to you and trying to explain the greatness of what Ronaldo did in 2019 The comeback, the topic is too great to be described with mere words, you must see it in order to feel its greatness.Sohaib é o melhor crítico de cinema da história..
It is unfair to write a review and evaluation of Oppenheimer's film, it is like someone coming to you and trying to explain the greatness of what Ronaldo did in 2019 The comeback, the topic is too great to be described with mere words, you must see it in order to feel its greatness......"
"I was so excited for this film. We had to walk out after an hour, which felt like two. Every scene was about 20 seconds, you had no time to digest what was happening or why and who any of the smaller characters were. One minute he's in a classroom the, next he's in the desert on a horse. Parties, classroom, back on a horse. WHY!?! It did seem like the film was slowing down when he was recruited for the Manhattan Project but by that point I'd lost all faith in the film. Maybe when it finally hits Netflix or something I'll start it again from where I left but that was one of the worst hours of cinema I've ever witnessed. Even the dialogue felt rushed like they knew it was pointless so they just wanted to get through it. How about just not including it?"
"Cutting to the chase, I did not know how this would turn out. The media was hyping it up. After watching it, I was speechless. The music is a masterpiece, cinematography is amazing, acting is so strong.The movie makes you go through a roller coaster of emotions. The only drawback is the runtime, with can sometimes become repetitive however nothing took me out of the loop, it was interesting enough and had twists.Well worth it. Everything was building up to that one atomic and boy did it deliver. Cilian did amazing as Oppenheimer, brought his character to the very depths of all the emotions."
"A great biopic with a stacked movie cast! What more can you ask. A lot of clues and relevant links to many things throughout the movie so keep your eyes peeled. Cinematography and some of the mise en scenes were so nice to see. The use of non-diegetic sounds also made this movie, (the chair was literally rocking due to the sound effects, you could feel the sound if that makes sense). What kept this movie from being perfect was the fact that the actual explosion episodes were just a tad underwhelming but that's understandable because the movie isn't just about big explosions. The film actually gives us the insight to what Mr Oppenheimer is holding himself responsible for being the father of the atomic bomb. He's created something that can put an end to the world at once and he has to live with that sense of guilt, it will forever stay. His name will be renowned even after he passes."
I won't waste.. It's an epic movie.. From all Chris movies.. 3 hours went so deep inside.. I would love to see and watch it again. Time with nolen is definitely there in this epic movie.. Its for history.. Flash back.. Black and color moments bringing an extra advantage to the movie.. I prefer watching it in imax.. Soundtrack was amazing and wonderful.. Go watch it now and believe me its worth it movie like oppenheimer.. With all my respect for those who gave 7 or 8 out of 10.. I will give it 9 at least.. In Gulf dubai Kuwait and doha and oman ksa is sold out very fast.. Even mission impossible was not like that.
"Im an avrage movie watcher and i rate every movie a good one, but this actually changed my point of view about good movies.This is a pure masterpiece. The movie is so well made and everything is very enjoyable, the emotions of the actors and everything was on point. Murphy did a wonderful job but lets not forget about Downey jr. And Jason Clarke who gave such intense emotions which made me very curious about what will happend next. The fx were incredible and everything seemed so realistic you could'nt tell if it was real or computer made. I encourage watching it on a 70 mm imax for the best experience but even a simple cinema will get the standards high. Congrats to Christian Nolan and to everyone from the production."
"But it wasn't boring for me. Its just that every bloody talking scene had some poor sod on a violin doing tension music. Completely lost track of the plot here and there (so many people and lts of mumbling). But good performances all round esp Downey.I suppose my overriding thought is, to quote the film, ""nobody in Hiroshima or Nagasaki cares who invented the bloody bomb."" I guess I don't either. And he had a conscience. And problems with women. And a troubled childhood that was ignored in the filmIts like Nolan was worried it would be boring so peppered it with nipples, tricks and gimmicks.I saw it on Imax and that was a waste of money - I was not blown away. We went home and re-watched the documentary. Fascinating story."
"I think this is a massively overhyped, seriously underwhelming film which I am afraid I gave up on halfway through! Watching it was such a slog, I struggled to stay awake - and that doesn't happen to me!It's unrelenting documentary style is not easy to engage with and there are very few lighter moments to entice the viewer to keep watching or to become emotionally involved.The story jumps from one era to another, dialogue is so heavy and the whole film just drags incessantly on and on like a tedious school history lesson, where you can't help checking your watch again and again!Avoid at all costs is my advice!"
"I loved the acting, the shots, and the sound. The beginning of the movie is incredible with foreshadowing and explaining the history. The build up to the test detonation is like no other. Violins, intensity and just amazing shots once the bomb drops. The movie has a great mix of both the personal and work life of Oppenheimer. Where it takes a dive is after the test bomb. I feel like Nolan could've captured more of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the effect it had on the people in Japan. He shows nothing and sort of skips over it. Ending was slightly dragged out but the last scene is breathtaking. Overall one of Nolan's best but a tier below interstellar/ dark night."
Recently watched Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer in 70 MM IMAX and was absolutely stunned by the visuals I love every part of this movie. I thought that the whole movie really in bodied Oppenheimer I like the use of no visual effects in this movie it really gives the movie the authentic film experience I think everyone should watch this film. I walked into this movie with no knowledge of Oppenheimer even though I have heard of him I think Oppenheimer didn't get the respect he deserved until this this film. This movie might be in my top 3 I haven't seen such a good movie since interstellar (also one of Nolan's films) I think the three hours flies bye and is enough time to see the life of Robert J. Oppenheimer.
"Going into this movie I already know it is going to be different and slow pace than Nolan's other movies. Which isn't bad. The score, cinematography, script and atmosphere is top notch. It make you feel like you really are back in time. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr acting are some of the best I have seen. Cillian really catch Oppenheimer perfectly. His struggle with creating the atomic bomb and the questioning of his loyalty to the US at the end will keep you on the edge. The atomic bomb test scene is one of the best I have seen in cinema. The score bringing up the tension and nervousness of the people there. To the sound and vision of the atomic bomb exploding. With no cgi. This is a once in a life time movie experience. I would recommend watching it."
"Now I know that what I might say might be a tad bit controversial... but I genuinely for the life of me do not understand how people are giving this film such high reviews and Barbie such low reviews. I watched these two films together (started with Barbie and then Oppenheimer) and wholeheartedly speaking Barbie comes on top (there was depth to the characters, the performances were amazing, the storyline brilliant, the emotions and humor tugged at your heartstrings). The same cannot be said for Oppenheimer. The film was good, not amazing but good. The cinematography was fantastic, performances brilliant. However, at 3 hours long the film did not keep my attention, if anything I fell asleep only to wake up towards the middle of the movie which is why I'm giving my score of 7/10. The storyline dragged, the characters were written well but were tiring to watch at times. I would say wait for the film to come out on Apple TV and rent it from there."
Was concerned for the length of the film but was so gripped the whole time it flew past. A better understanding of history with brilliant acting all the way through. The best film I've seen in a long time. Cillian Murphy needs to win awards for this and I will be shocked if he doesn't. A story that was explained told so it's understandable and very interesting. Finally something brilliant to be shown at the cinemas. The trailers and promotion for this film do not do it justice and I cannot believe the amount of famous faces that kept popping up. 10/10 recommend this to anyone considering going to view it.
To truly understand and enjoy the film you need to read the book first. There are any number of subtle nods to the book and Oppenheimer's life that are missed unless you know.The cinematography is utterly amazing and it's best seen in IMAX.An all star cast and many seasoned character actors help bring this film to life. Robert Downey Jr plays a role of a lifetime as does Cillian Murphy. I was fully engaged and never moved from my seat the entire three hour film.Oppenheimer's life led him to be an American hero even with all his flaws. The film covers only about 20 years of his life but leaves you wanting to know more.
"Overall it's Nolan. Intence,deep long conversations,and great cinematography, your brain have to be 100% active all the time, You know what I'm talking about if you've seen his previous works/films. Well it was not as confusing as tenet. Cillian Murphy carried the whole film, also the sound effects are incredible. This movie lives on your expectations, everything was worth it. The cast is perfect and specially cillian Murphy rocks man totally gives the feel, this was just an another masterpiece dropped by Christopher Nolan, I suggest that watch it on biggest screen possible, blindy go for IMAX, dont dare to miss a single second of the movie.overall the movie was pure cinema."
"Words can't explain how beautifully crafted this film is. Christopher Nolan just continues to produce mastermind film making. Perfect music score. There was not one moment within the film that I was not truly intrigued. The non linear timeline of the story further builds suspense, which is much needed in a 3 hour film. The acting was absolutely phenomenal and reveals the tension in each scene. The attention to detail with the historical details and physics terminology is further impressive such as the sound from the trinity test occurring a bit after the bomb was detonated. Truly astonished by Nolan's cinematic choices with each film he creates."
"Its about the f Bomb and the maker so .. that is that , i thank all the staff and specially cillian murphy for the effort on making the movie ,Peace.If you're looking for biographical and emotional at the same time yes you can find it here , but if you looking for action thats no no action in that , Murphy just nailed it cuz he has that good character look for 19s era and seems so gentle , otherwise I don't think anyone will fit that style.I would suggest that you search for some information about oppenheimer befor watching it well reveal hidden things of his life that its in the story but the movie just showing it straight out without details."
"Oppeneheimer is a very bond, brilliant and important movie. This film is very important from a technical point of view because it introduces a completely new format in cinema (KODAK b&w). The way this story is told is unique, but also very interesting. Actually, the story of Oppenheimer had to be told exactly like that. With a fantastic cast, this film takes us on an unforgettable historical experience that we all need to be familiar with. The mention of world famous scientists is presented very carefully and somewhat moderately (Einstein, Heisenberg, Bhor and of course Oppenheimer), which is the essence of this story.,,I believe we did it."""
"This has to be greatest movie of this decade. Stunning background music, acting and cinemetography makes this movie hook this audience even for three hours. Also the movie just don't only revolve around the making of atomic bomb but also contains the court drama after math where Robert J. Oppenheimer will be accused of being connected with communist party. This movie also showcase the political view and some glimpse of Oppenheimer's college life. But the most importantly this movie display the regret of Oppenheimer aftermath. Cillian Murphy had nailed in his character with his emotions and also the support cast has done their job brilliantly."
"A very fast paced film that jumped forwards and backwards a lot. Additionally, it had some weird decisions regarding music and camera movement that (I'm not an expert on the art of film making but I enjoy it and study it). Can be hard to follow if you don't have enough knowledge regarding American and War history. A small amount of scenes could've in my opinion, done without the loud music as it made it difficult to understand dialogue and feel connected in the story. However, the film had amazing performances by the cast, brilliant use of sound and lighting to influence the audience's emotions as well as incredible visuals that invite you into the story. Creating a historical film can be challenging as the actions of characters and events are extremely limited to what is and was accurate, but Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful film that covers a significant event in history, which needs to be acknowledged more as it has impacted society a lot more than people think."
Tbh this movie should've brought no 1 and much and much more than barbie movie but time is now rolling with feminist movie well I don't know this Oppenheimer movie is the best there ever was or will be and should be no 1 forever i really loved it and Christopher Nolan is gem of a director.If people were honest they give this movie 10 rating but yet Barbie is getting all the top box office wonders why is that i guess people rate this high but instead go watch barbie.This movie should be no 1 at box office but i guess people are falling for that feminist movie but i stick with this Oppenheimer.
"Oppenheimer is one of if not the greatest films I've ever seen, every scene and every moment of this film had me captivated, I couldn't take my eyes off of it, I have never been so concentrated on a movie that I didn't fidget with my hands or check my phone, this movie kept me awake the entire 3 hours length, and that's saying something as I have ADHD and can't focus on movies sometimes. During Oppenheimer I laughed I cried and most of all I felt could feel, genuinely a perfect in my opinion. If you have the time to watch it I 100% recommend watching it, it's probably the best film out right now."
"I went to this movie with maybe too high expectations. I loved Nolan's work so far, with Interstellar as my all time favorite movie. Seeing the ratings and read the user reviews i really thought this couldn't go wrong.Nothing seems to be the case. I've seen it last night and all morning i am wondering where the high ratings come from. I have watched a documentary for 3 long long hours, without any excitement . The bomb explosion scene was the only good thing in this movie, all the rest is plain boring chatter with 4 different storylines running trough each other. Nolan added a black and white storyline because he must have realized that most of the people otherwise wouldn't get anything of the movie at all.I really hate to say it : Don't waste your time to go see it. You're warned."
"This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, easily the easiest 3 hours of film watching ever. The great juxtaposition of the brilliance and downfall of man and the destruction science/men can bring. The music was amazing, the acting exceptional and the end very thought provoking.Every scene felt totally immersive and engaging. I felt the fear of the scientist when creating a new form of weapon and not knowing if it would destory the whole world upon detention. I felt the guilt of Oppenheimer and realizing what he actually had accomplished. It was such a beautiful masterpiece that leaves you thinking. I will definitely be making the story of Oppenheimer my new hyper fixation of the month."
"I had the advantage of reading ""American Prometheus""'several years ago, otherwise some of the history and internal squabbles over ""Atomic versus Hydrogen"" bomb would have been lost on me. You don't have to read the book first but it will help. But I'm either case, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. We are all living in Oppenheimer's world, for better or worse. He deserves all the accolades he's ever received, and he was a very flawed human being. But give me someone who wrestled with his demons any day over the person who never reflected on their earlier actions with despair and guilt. Oppenheimer the man is for the ages, as is this movie."
"The Oppenheimer movie is an emotional rollercoaster, it awakes your senses being a visual and audio masterpiece, it's truly a statement of cinematic art and an art piece that raises the bar for future productions for it's perfection in the smallest details from makeup to sound to image to script ECT...
The cast was pure genius Florence Pugh was more than perfect in role execution , she is a torch carrier for the next generation of actors the energy and mixture of actors was in it self art like colors in a painting coming together to express or reflect a complex texture of emotions .And that's what created this cinematic wonder."
"I learned a lot about the basics if this event.Scenario : I learned a lot about how the methodology ans the path on building the H bomb, the morals this building would discuss internationnally, I learned which people met whom at that era and what were the consequences of the H bomb building.Aestethic angle : The photography of the movie wasn't forgotten as we could feel the beauty of the colors. The sounds développée for the movie and the choice to mute some scene are important as this is the best way to feel the explosion of bomb in a movie...then came the sounds of the explosion as the thunders work.Movie soundtrack : It was a good enough music to be spotted by movie soundtrack lovers' ears, I sure shall listen to it again !"
"It's long, but it speeds along and takes concentration which is so refreshing. Nolan takes audience on a unique and brilliant cinematic journey. Cast is excellent, with cameos from so many great actors was a whose who of acting master class! The story is one that should be better known and after this it Will definitely be well known.It's definitely one that needs to be seen in the cinema to get the full experience. If Cillian and Downey don't clear up in the awards season it will be a travesty. The torment after what was created and the impact of it is depicted in such a clever way. Definitely become a classic."
"Openheimer is an amazing movie from start to finish. Cillian Murphy's performance is Oscar worthy and Christopher Nolan's directing as always is absolutely fantastic.The story is just prefect, we get a good look at the live of 'The father of the atomic bomb'. We see how making the A-bomb changed him and how it changed the rest of the world. This movie perfectly shows how the making of the A-bomb was one of the most important moments in the history of mankind The movie is understandable for everyone, even if you don't know much about the A-bomb it's an enjoyable movie.In my opinion this is one of the best movies of this decade."
"BORING ... OVERHYPED ... WASTAGE OF TIME AND MONEY ....
I just watched the movie in the theater. I have never been so excited to watch a movie. I studied about Manhattan Project so much since my high school days. I am now 38 years old. But I have to say that I am really disappointed. This movie is OVER-HYPED. The three-hour-long movie is really dull. While the section on Manhattan Project is interesting, I find many scenes redundant and boring. The film could have been condensed into less duration removing unnecessary scenes. All actors did a great job in their respective roles. But Christopher Nolan has disappointed me with mixing various elements in a haphazard way. This movie is OK - But NOT GOOD and definitely NOT GREAT. I am really very disappointed."
"Christopher Nolan has, indeed, tried to walk a different path with this movie - but this is based on a true story after all with a clear message to all in the present circumstance/s the world is venturing in. People always had that greed for fake popularity since time immemorial or you say being a charlatan. And things haven't changed much till date, have they? This is a movie that may not thrill you but will drive you emotionally.If you get absorbed in this movie, your emotions will kick in and channelise in a way that you will start asking yourself if you have been carrying out your duties in a humane way! The onus is more pronounced if you are a scientist and you invent something that is eventually or more meant for mass destruction. Persons of quality never expect anything in return - they just do their duty in a bohemian style only to be termed gullible or naive at the end. Perhaps, they enjoy it being that way only!"
"I had no knowledge of the who's who in the making of The Bomb, so I think I had an unbiased opinion.The film was extremely well made, a difficult subject to try and follow if you dont know physics but despite that I think it portrayed how the feelings and emotions of those involved felt about what they are doing. I thoroughly enjoyed it but will probably have to re watch to fully understand the politics of it all.1
Again it shows that those in power don't care about the social and personal impact of making such a device on the individual.The top brass weren't interested in how their actions played out in the long run."
"I was young when I first saw one of Christopher Nolan's films "" Inception"" I couldn't understand anything but yet I felt the emotions and the rush he delivers.Now I'm happy and glad that I saw his work in my 20's I can finally understand.Oppenheimer made me feel the horror and the power of physics and made me respect the scientist even more, I felt bad for the innocent civilians who got affected by the Bomb.This movie's visuals, sounds, transitions will make your heart race and force you to pay attention. The dialogue and the story is outstanding.You will be connected deeply to the character."
"Perfect Nolan's treat Worth watching it. Cillian Murphy's screen presence and Downey's performance nailed it. Kept the audience on their seat for the whole duration. Even if it looks like a documentary film it really deals with a lot starting off from Oppenheimer till the bomb. Nolan did his magic again with the cast and in techincal terms. Don't miss this epic art.The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!"
"In ways that only Christopher Nolan can do, Oppenheimer is a layered, critical thinking film with A-list surprises, brilliant cinematography, and a hell of a sound mixing team. There's history, there's science, there's humanity- it's all there for the viewer to interpret as deeply (or superficially) as they like. I love Christopher Nolan because I feel I can trust his work; sure there's some suspension of belief (it is Hollywood after all), but you know you'll walk away from the movie lingering on subtle scenes, powerful dialogue, challenging morals, etc. There's always always something to think about and relish, and Oppenheimer does not disappoint!"
"Can even a history film be told non-linearly? Yes it can. Only a legend Christopher Nolan could do this. There may be other directors can do, it takes a certain courage to tell a story like this. Science and politics are shown in this film and that too with perfect elegance. Must watch in theaters.Many people are questioning where the bombing scene is in Japan. It is unnecessary for this story. We came to see Oppenheimer's story. Not the suffering of the Japanese. Watch this movie with proper understanding.So overall it is a good intellectual movie. Really enjoyed my imax experience. Good 👍🏻"
"This movie being shot in 70mm IMAX film doesn't make any sense once I watched it, the movie itself isn't very cinematic. Additionally the film throws around so many names and characters it makes it very hard to follow dialogue and story. I walked out being confused and a little underwhelmed. Near the end, the movie will lose most of the audience with all of the concepts, characters and lawsuits style scenes the last for a third of the movie. Personally the movie got worse and worse, with looser plot and story as it went. The one thing I well give Nolan is the sound design and ost, so goddamn good, it's my favorite part. Lastly, it felt like the whole movie revolved and written around the ending quote in the movie."
"Actually saying I wasted 3 hours of my life is a bit harsh. This movie did hold my attention for most of the time and I only dozed off once. Perhaps if I had been more prepared and brushed up on my history, it would probably have been better. I had absolutely no idea who most of the people were or what their actual significance was, politically or otherwise. I'm a bit embarrassed that I didn't know more about them as I am 67 years old and my dad served overseas in WW2. I went to see the movie with three friends who are in their 70's and I don't believe they got much if any more out of it than I did. It was a very disappointing movie for all of us.Maybe I will read up on the people in the film and who they actually were, watch it again when it is available on streaming platforms, and may give a better rating."

"""Oppenheimer"" is an exceptional movie that captivates its audience with its compelling storytelling, brilliant performances, and breathtaking cinematography. The film masterfully portrays the life and achievements of J. Robert Oppenheimer, shedding light on his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. With a thought-provoking narrative and a deep exploration of ethical dilemmas, it leaves viewers pondering the consequences of scientific discoveries. Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a must-see film that brilliantly captures the complexities of history and the human condition."
"The tense, examination towards the end of the movie is one of the greatest plot points of a movie I have ever seen. One minor complaint, that stops it from being a 10/10, is the explosive audio towards the opening of the film, in a particular scene with RDJ the music was so loud that it made the dialogue of the scene unclear. Emily Blunt was an absolutely incredible portrayal of Kitty Oppenheimer, especially during the examination when Dr Oppenheimer is questioned with regards to his relationship with Jean the known communist, The movie moves at an absolutely beautiful pace, and did not feel like a 3 hour movie at all. A true masterpiece. In my opinion, this is a contender for the greatest film we will ever see. Nolan deserves praise."
This movie is a master piece through and through. Not one part of it was bad. This movie single handedly is the best one that's come out in years since covid slammed the movie industry into the dirt. There's been disappointment after disappointment in the years since its ended. This movie is not that though. The entire story is told in full detail without leaving out any of it in a perfectly easy way to follow. The sound track was also amazing in this. This entire movie will single handedly be the best some of these actors and the director ever took part in. It's also my strong opinion that anyone that says it was bad is a dumb as idiot that probably has no interest in history.
"""Oppenheimer 2023"" is a well-directed film, but it may be overly complicated for some viewers. The film will likely appeal to history buffs who are already familiar with the historical character, but casual movie watchers may find themselves tuning out a quarter of the way in. The sex scenes with Pugh seem shoehorned into the movie that didn't need them and don't add much to the overall narrative. Without these scenes, the film could have been rated PG-13 and made available to a wider audience. Overall, if you're into historical narratives, this film is for you. However, if you're just looking for entertainment, you may find yourself checking the clock."
"The week before I watched a documentary on TV about Oppenheimer so I new about his turbulent and interesting life. Was curious to see how Nolan dramatized it.From the first second on you are met with an fast cut editing style that make you feel you are watching a trailer. There are lots of conversations, which I don't mind, but its cut like they do in Youtube videos. Non-stop, back-to-back. No room for a silent moment, a scenic establish shots or a touching moment.No time to get close to ""Oppie"".After an hour or so I noticed I have never been so aware of sitting in a cinema full of people. Watching the ceiling. Oh, look, someone is getting up to visit the toilet.. Realized this movie is boring me to bits. Gave it another half hour. Then left."
"Thanks to the all actors and directors!Oppenheimer was full of drama and facts which leads me to live into the scenarios! I really recommended of this movie not for actions fans! You must be caution in every moment and have at least a bit background of politics.I wish there will be peace around the world especially this time when we see the news between Russia & Ukraine. Because the movie released in this time where the world in trouble a bit, so hopefully nothing getting worse.I am very happy and want to see it again but this time VIP. Murphy was more better than Tom Shelby in that film."
"This movie in my opinion is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Even at 3 hours long every scene is important to understanding who Oppenheimer is and keeps you engaged. If you know nothing about the 40s and 50s i would recommend doing a little research about the cold war, ww2 and world politics during that era just so it's easier to follow in the beginning (not necessary to enjoy the film). This is the only movie that I have seen, with zero action and still has you on the edge of your seat. The acting was absolutely incredible not just from the main characters but from every little person in the story. Cinematography is stunning as you would come to expect from a Nolan film. Overall if you love storytelling and a great film that isn't just run and gun action or superheroes then this movie will not only keep you engaged but will have you thinking and talking on the car ride home."
"The movie was very exceptional . Christopher Nolan's vision was fulfilled in this movie . The cinematography , the cgi everything was top notch . The actors in this movie , incuding Cillian Murphy ,Emily Blunt , Robert Downey Jr, everyone gave their best efforts . Ad a science student , the actual physics terms in this movie seemed a bit basic but perfect nonetheless .Cillian Murphy , espescially , was perfect for the role of Oppenheimer . Him depicting Oppenheimer's agony as he gave a peech to the people and during the trials was exceptional . Overall the movie was very well made , with every single small detail in mind . I have tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible , but i think i have written only the basic things ."
"The acting, cinematography, musical score, editing, everything about this film was flawless. This is the culmination of Christopher Nolan's life's work. This will be one of those movies that everyone has in their top 10 list. RDJ, Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt lead an allstar cast that don't miss many spots in the telling of their story. Such an immense era in the history of our nation's military development amidst the the changing global landscape of physics needed this level of acting. Even in the scenes that were simply story building dialoge, the weight of the moment could be felt by the viewer. A masterpiece from start to finish."
"Oppenheimer is a delight as good cinema. From the performances of Murphy and Downey Jr., Damon and Malik, to the staging, they give the film a pace that doesn't slow down in its 3 hours, at times conveying the feeling of being overwhelmed by their characters. Nolan proves to be very solid in the biographical genre, showing in great detail one of the most iconic and thorny moments of the entire 20th century. Definitely an important historical document; a film to show in schools and reflect on how the start of this arms race marks a before and after in geopolitics and how our actions, however altruistic, sometimes have unsuspected consequences."
"Oppenheimer is very much a beautifully shot, edited and scored achievement in filmmaking. However, this movie, either by design or unintentionally is not as gripping or thrilling as other Nolan movies. Perhaps, the audience should have expected this given that it was marketed as a biopic. But, still, with Nolan at the helm, I expected more suspense. The stakes of the Manhattan project were existential, yet that feeling of existentialism was lacking throughout the film. Cillian Murphy's performance was masterful, but I don't feel that I learned anything of substance about the subject he was portraying."
"We get it, you shot it in special 70 millimeter frames. Mediocre movie with some bright stars such as Florence Pugh and the lead. Not particularly engaging or well thought out. Seems overly fond of itself, and entirely too long. Nolan has a few good moments as a storyteller but it just seems he banks on his namesake and pretentious self important viewers who god forbid smile or watch something other than somber, dark themes. Boring and missing quite a lot for a three hour movie. Could've used more emotional intelligence and gone deeper into the human psyche but alas, what do we expect from a male director. Yawn."
"This is a film to be watched many times. So many layers intertwined to majestically compose a perfect description of Oppenheimer's life,inside out. The guilt. The genius. The lover. The rational. The success yet the deep dark feeling that said success generated. The politics. The effects of an idiot with power. The loyalty and the treason. All of this about one of the most important moments in human history. How can you combine all these in a single film? Certainly Nolan had the answer, along with brilliant actors that bring to the audience a living sensation as if it would be a real life experience."
"The movie is a masterpiece. You can feel the character's difficulties and the storms blowing inside him deeply and sincerely. I saw the movie in IMAX and if you had told me it was a horror movie I wouldn't have objected. Albert Einstein was handled very well and the connection between what Openheimer said to him in the last scene and the first scene was perfect and fascinating. Personally, I felt Openheimer's regret even in myself. Chillian Murphy did a great job and even the supporting actors in the movie were Oscar-worthy. After leaving the movie, I questioned life for about 15 minutes in the corridor of the cinema and I felt the same feeling even at home. A movie that will stay with you for a long time after watching it. Classic Christopher Nolan Thank you."
"I was at the premiere of the movie and it was amazing! I want to thank the entire team that worked on this movie, you guys are really cool! In the film everything was on the highest level, the cast, cinema, musical accompaniment, plot, sound, in one word everything! Throughout the film, he keeps the viewer in some tension, as if you are experiencing all the emotions that Oppenheimer himself experienced.Watching these movies makes you realize how much the human brain can do. One can create nuclear weapons, and one can create a genius film, and the third (as I) sit to admire the first two! )))"
"The main point one comes away with from Oppenheimer is that humanity isn't ready to have the power it possesses and its just a matter of time until we blow ourselves up in nuclear annihilation. Sadly, this film is timed perfectly as we are now fearing a nuclear armed Russia as well as other rogue countries. A phrase comes to mind, before you asked if you should, you did. Oppenheimer is a deep movie, lot's is going on. Be sure and know what you are getting into. It's a brilliant film, but it's not for everyone. Cillian Murphy will win best actor, Nolan best director, Blount best female actor and a score of other awards will go to this film. This movie is an experience, much like 2001 is an experience. I will probably see it again very soon."
"2.5 hours of torture. Enjoyed only 30 minutes of science discussion. Whole movie was based on countries ideological battle. US thinks communism is bad for everyone and it will destroy humanity. US centric approach is always right, that's what they think. Whole movie is based on useless group discussions multiple times. Very well promoted. Boring and pathetic dialogues. I was feeling sleepy after 1 hour. Don't know why they wasted 3 hours on a topic which could be covered in a 15-30 minutes of short description. I feel Christopher Nolan wasted money and resources on such short topic which we can read within 15 minutes."
"Oppenheimer is probably up there with one of the best films I've seen... in a very long time. The feeling you have through the whole 3 hours is gargantuan - it leaves you feeling sad and scared throughout. The quick edited scenes, the feeling of dread in every scene, with the use of intense music and sound. It was most definitely did not feel like a 3 hour movie. The pacing is just right, the blend of the storyline, from start to finish is like a loud and finely tuned machine. Probably my favourite Nolan film to date. I'm sure others will think Nolan has done better, but it's probably my personal favourite. I 100% intend going to see it again at the cinema - if you are planning on watching this, find time to watch it at the cinema, and if you can, an IMAX, this film is an experience."
"Always in the hallmark of a Nolan-style film, the setting is made magnificently and beautifully and adds cinema value. The sound of this film is amazing. The way the time is placed in this film makes this film more complicated than usual films. Overall, I am very satisfied with this film. Maybe this movie is the best movie i've ever watched so far. The IMAX format makes it extraordinary. Maybe a slight drawback is that there are too many facts that happen in one minute and it keeps hitting the audience's brain, but maybe that's what Nolan wants to emphasize on the audience, namely a sense of complexity, confusion, anxiety, reflecting Oppenheimer's regret after what happened in Japan. Truly cinema. Really masterpiece. Salute to the director, director, cast and crew."
"Best biopic I've ever seen
The best thing about the movie is the sound effects and sound engineering
Of course, the photography is awesome, especially since even black and white is captured using iMax technologyDirector Christopher Nolan did not let us down, even though he changed the type of films that we are used to and fascinate us
But he didn't changed his wonderful way of narrating events
I was sure I would come out happy from the movie
But I didn't imagine that I would reach this degree of happiness
Advice before you watch the movie, you must know who Oppenheimer is
You can search for it
And in an episode of Al-Dahih program, speaking about Oppenheimer
Really clarified a lot of events
But if you do not know the story or are expected to watch Nolan's usual films, I would like to tell you that you will not understand anything."
"Oppenheimer instantly enters the discussion for best film ever made, with impecable editing, scarring music and towering performances from a solid cast. Nolan's screenplay is incisive and detailed, with enough material to make the 3 hours feel like not enough time to devour this delicious work of art. Blending the thriller and the political courthouse drama, Christopher Nolan crafted an innovative cinematic experience that's both grand but shockingly sensitive and intimate. The tension, brought to its absolute limit in what may be the most tense countdown sequence ever made, is ultimately released in a shattering revelation that feels like a bucket of ice-cold water thrown at your body in the film's final moments. This masterclass in balance of an abundance of rich elements makes Oppenheimer a thoroughly engrossing victory that makes one feel as conflicted as the man behind its title: happy to have witnessed it but disheartened by its consequence."
"What is good:
The movie has great storylines. Mr. Nolan is the master in story telling. I was never feeling bored during the 3 hr movie. The flashback combine with black/white and color scene tells great stories. For someone who is interested in the WW2 history, this movie is a must to recommend.What is not good enough:
The depict of Straus as the con-man in my view is a fail. Straus is just a microcosm of the macro McCarthyism culture that has been rampant during that time. I would love to see Straus, who is a controversial character in American history, to be also fighting for his ideology instead of just revenging on a small argument. This further signifies how ideology tears apart society and nobody can escape."
"Awesome acting, makeup, wardrobe all over here. Loved it. Obviously king but I didn't know all of the history behind this and it taught me a lot. I'd like to see it again as I'm sure I'll catch way more nuance than the first go. Acting was fantastic and I loved how they mixed up black and white ""footage"" with the more real time color aspects. Suspenseful soundtrack as well. Literally had suspense until the last line of the movie so don't leave early. Nothing exciting in the first half of the credits, at least that I saw as I headed out. Wild historical story that changed the course of the world and beyond unfortunately."
"Oppenheimer is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged cinematic experience. With its exceptional performances, especially from Cillian Murphy and Robert DJ, the film delves deep into the moral dilemmas of scientific progress and the burden of responsibility. Nolan's directorial prowess and storytelling mastery shine once again, making Oppenheimer a powerful and unforgettable cinematic experience.Movies like Oppenheimer challenge us to grapple with the complexities of history, science, and the human condition. They remind us of the power and responsibility we hold as individuals and as a society to use our knowledge and capabilities for the greater good.On my way home after watching the film, I found myself experiencing a mix of emotions - sadness, admiration, and perhaps even a sense of existential contemplation."
"Probably the most thought-provoking big-budget studio film in the last 20 years. While this was a fine film, the acting was utterly tremendous. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downy Junior, and Emily Blunt put on a true masterclass in acting, dwarfed only by the magnitude of Oppenheimer's life's work: the atomic bomb. Magnificent performances, and as far as big-budget studio films go, Oppenheimer may be second to none. The film had so many layers, and was truly one of the finest examples of the magnitude of life's everlasting consequences. It's silly to say a commercially successful movie will clean up at awards season, but it would be a travesty if the Cillian, RDJ, and Emily Blunt didn't all get a statue, as well as the sound team, and cinematography."
"Mr Nolan never disappoints. The hype, the legacy leading up to the actual cinematic experience stands true right from the very first scene. The stark contrast, the character plays so well in the movie and is so engrossing that one will forget that this is the longest movie of Mr Nolan. The casting, the performances makes it a movie which is not to be missed if you are even if you are just a fun-viewer.Mr Nolan's dabbling into the biography genre and building up of characters, the time lapses, the dialogues are so aptly matched up with the corresponding scenes that it makes you forget that you are watching it from few metres away from the screen. This movie is an experience worth going for and it sucks you in the narrative of the two main characters in a way that while watching any other biographical genre movie will have too much expectations."
"I went to see this movie in the theatre, knowing about the Manhattan project loosely with little knowledge. It is well done, and once you sit through the first 20 minutes, the movie's ADHD back and forth makes sense. To avoid spoilers, I will mention the cinematography. There are 2 scenes that blew me away. One is the Trinity test, which faithfully and almost meticulously recreates actual filmed parts of the test and preparations for it, is bone chilling. The other scene at the end, with another person, makes a great ending, and the accompanying soundtrack almost makes you feel obligated to feel the emotions they are talking about. If possible, I would recommend seeing it in IMAX because it is actually designed for it, and I REALLY want to see it in IMAX now, even though I saw it yesterday. The only downside was the sometimes confusing story, but the overall story is understandable."
"Like anything Nolan has everdone, it is overly long, pretentious and overrated by his rabid fanbase. A real snooze fest.The subject matter is so compelling . I was expecting an explosion, but instead what i got was a dudI thought this movie would be 'da bomb ' but it failed to ignite any interestBad puns aside, the acting was good but the plot and narrative were sub par. . I've seen people throwing around the idea that this is a masterpiece but i felt it was seriously lacking. In terms of commentary on nucelar annhilation I'll stick to
kubrick's Dr strange love. Nolan is the poor man's Kubrick."
"This film is definitely worth watching. The cinematic experience is out of this world and makes you leave the theatre almost in the state of shock. The cast, the story and simply every aspect of this film is a masterpiece. Even though film is generally considered an art form, I have yet to encounter a film more worthy of the title of art than Oppenheimer. As I saw critics and media portraying this film at the top of the industry, I had more than high expectations and they were all met. As I was running a bit late to the cinema I didn't have enough time to buy popcorn or any snacks, which was honestly a save of money since all my focus was immediately captured when Oppenheimer showed up on the screen so I am not sure I would even be able to eat it."
"What does the film represent? A story about the manhattan project and the making of the atomic bomb, but also a detailed view into a mind which saw things not many could see. Oppenheimer shows that all along, he knew exactly what he was doing, they all knew they were building a bomb with huge destructive capabilities, yet went with it anyway. These people on the project were scientists and the film really shows that there was a fine line of morality that each one was crossing when pushing for innovation, which ultimately led to destruction. In the end, Oppenheimer never regretted what he did, he may have felt remorseful about the deaths, but Nolan captures that really he knew he was the most important man on the planet at the time and people would listen to whatever he had to say. A gentle soul, yet strong egotistical and somewhat political view on the world."
"My star rating for this movie will not be accurate because you can not put anything higher than 10. All i can say is christopher nolan is an absolute genius. The movie was incredible. I left the theater with tears in my eyes and jaw dropped to the popcorn covered floor. Still processing life after seeing this incredible masterpiece that must be placed beside the mona lisa. Scratch that, it must REPLACE the mona lisa. When a movie makes your body freeze and stop breathing you know it's good. My therapist will be pleased to hear that i'm close to finding the meaning of life after this movie. Thank you to christopher nolan and the entire cast of oppenheimer for reminding us all of what movies are meant to do."
"My favorite movie has always been ""Interstellar."" No other film could evoke such emotions in me as it does. Christopher Nolan's new film once again managed to bring back those feelings and sensations while watching it. When you watch ""Oppenheimer,"" you experience the entire range of emotions and sensations that a film can offer. Throughout all three hours, you'll be thrilled by the brilliance of the film, screenplay, music, visual effects, acting, directing, and cinematography. Everything is meticulously thought out and meaningful, making it exceptionally perfect and captivating. You completely immerse yourself in the film and become a part of it, living the lives of the characters, sharing their emotions. After viewing, there's a sense of fulfillment and a pleasant aftertaste. Christopher Nolan's films prompt contemplation and reflection, as they should after watching a movie. I recommend them to anyone who appreciates quality cinema, values art, and simply wants to delve into the world of great films."
"This film is the biography of the legendary Scientists Robert Oppenheimer. We saw the timeline of this film is during the second world war. How Germany is not invented the atomic bomb this film tell us the truth. Oppenheimer wife is comiunist and that's his big fault. At the end of this film we have a idea about this. This is not a tripical Nolan movie. We have see few change in it.cilian Murphy performance is superb. Robert Downey Jr role was nice portrait in this film. Sound quality was nice. In theaters the audience got goosebumps after hearing the sound. Screenplay,the dialog delivery by actor is good."
"Honestly one of the best movies Ive seen in a while. While this movie is 3 hours it completely kept my attention throughout. The actors portrayals were also fantastic. Particularly cillian murphy's, RDJrs and Emily blunt's.A few things to mention if you are going to watch it in IMAX theaters. I do recommend, however it is extremely loud right up to the point where if it was any louder I would've left. Also the dialogue was also sometimes hard to hear. So you'll have to weigh the pros and cons whether you want to see it in theaters. I would say the pros out way the cons tho.Overall I highly recommend. 9/10. Amazing. Can't give a 10 cause it's not perfect but almost."
"Knowing Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan project background this movie was absolutely fantastic to me and exceeded my expectations! However, people who do not have an insight other than the scientist who made the atomic bomb this movie can be complex and hard to follow. Especially if you think it's going to be all explosions and madness. No it's about Oppenheimers accomplishment, challenges and complex life. It's a must watch just read a little on his background first to follow and enjoy better! The cinematography, the sound, acting, quality, and soundtrack were all excellent and a must see in RPX or IMAX. (I swear the room was shaking you can feel the explosions)"
"What Christopher Nolan achieves with this film is monumental to his catalouge. He proves that he can do more than an insanely complicated plot where you dont know whats left and what right. This film relies on well written dialogue and a dominating performance by Cillian Murphy. Accompanying that is a great display by Robert Downey jr who portrays Lewis Strauss, Downey Jr, shows what he is capable of in Oppenheimer, where Tony Stark is far away.The sound in this film was for me the MVP, my seat buzzed and I got completely engulfed in the film. Without cgi this movie is more beautiful than most we see these days and the feeling afterwards is I need to see it again!I believe this film will be a dominating player at the next Academy Awards and where Nolan might finally be rewarded for his outstanding work."
"This is really overrated movie compared to nolan's other films. I did not understand the nudity even two times. The scenes are also not necessary and not important for the movie. So it feels me like someone told nolan to make a movie about the atomb bomb and he did it like that by highlight how america is great and all the others should be scared from them.However, it is good to see how americans react to successful atomb bomb by smiling, celebrating, being honored and pride. They even do not care how much people died.Cillian murph is acting great and i really like the ending but anyways everytime i said that i should watch it again in the cinema but i did not say these words after this oppenheimer."
"Tbh., this has to win every Oscar there is... Cillian Murphy is a genius actor and one of our generation's finest. The cinematography, the plot, the acting, the historic accuracy: just everything is perfect.I've seen quite a lot of bad reviews for this movie, since it doesn't contain action scenes or anything close. At the same time, people are angry because the anticipated nuclear explosion-scene isn't what some hoped for. This movie is about OPPENHEIMER before, during and after the Manhattan Project. It's not about the nuke per se. It is dialogue-heavy and you probably should have some historic context/background for this movie, before you watch it.All in all: MASTERPIECE!"
"Awful. Nolan is LOST. 2 hours and 40 minutes of meaningless dialogue, abrupt cutaways, nameless, empty characters and 20 minutes of real movie making/story telling. Robert Oppenheimer is an interesting, impactful figure in history, but clearly not worthy of a movie about his life if this is what we get. I cannot believe a master like Nolan can take such a juicy subject and turn it into the most tedious endurance tests one will ever face in a movie theatre. If you're interested in the Manhattan project you'll get a glimpse of it. If you're interested in seeing a two and a half hour interrogation into whether or not Robert Oppenheimer had communist ties whooo boy are you in for a treat. Cillian Murphy was fine. Nolan needs to find himself ASAP."
There's no sugar coating or talking about a different narrative here. We all know what really happened and this movie tries to glorify and make a message out of something that is a disgrace to humanity. I went in and really wanted to give it a fair go but the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous and I just couldn't get past it. Millions of people died for no reason despite surrending. There is no sugar coating it. The cast did a good job. Story was well paced. Directing was well done as expected. You have to focus and pay attention to really get lost in the movie and while it does those things moderately well.. but I still found this movie just a totally disrespectful for the human experience.
"Oppenheimer is a well made film. The music is amazing. The acting is phenomenal. The story upon which it is based is really interesting as well. The adaptation for the screen, however is blatantly somniferous. Taken into account the upward trend of magnificence in each consecutive Nolan film, this is an absolue low point. It contains the usual tricks: black and white different time lines; flashbacks to a happening undisclosed until the end; ticking tacking music; silence before complete blasting of your eardrums. But now with an A24 vibe... I can't imagine this film has lived up to anybody's expectations."
"It's a good movie, some have called it a 'masterpiece' and 'an important movie in our history'. It's watchable, the filming is beautiful and filmed in the Nolan style that most people love, it's a good story and the amount of famous actors is insane, clearly they fall over themselves these days to be in a Nolan movie. The film is long and although we'll written with some great performances I felt it lacks any real entertainment and tension with the exception of the test scenes, it feels a very political story. For me Nolan has clearly peaked, Batman, inception and interstellar where up there in most peoples top 5 of all time, Dunkirk, Tenet and now this are nowhere near that standard, it's worth a watch but don't expect an IMBD top 25 movie."
"The acting in this movie is insane. Absolutely incredible. Everyone. The plot and the dialogue is too much. It's all over the place. I frequently had to ask my friend what somebody said. I found myself zoning out when they would talk. I felt like I had 3 hours of elevated heart rate. It's a good movie with a lot of impact, but it felt a little lost to me. I also wish it put a heavier emphasis on the impact of what the bomb actually did in total vs. What it did to the men involved, however, I understand that was not the main purpose of the plot. I'm not a history or physics buff, so I had a hard time digesting this movie. Overall, it did bring a lot of awareness to what has happened and the people involved. Grateful for that, but I am not recommending this for everybody."
"Oppenheimer felt like a VERY long trailer because of very short scenes and a constant blaring soundtrack. A insane amount of details and names were thrown at you, while almost every single scene has a score playing. It only got interesting about 2/3rds into the film, but by then it was too late to save the overall experience - at least for me.The actors did well and I suppose it was beautifully filmed, but in my opinion in does not match the previous efforts of Nolan - not by a long stretch. A few scenes late in the film were amazing, but I will not be rewatching this in the future - unless they find a way to edit it intensely."
"The movie is very concentrated you can't miss a minute. At the start, few of the stars and solar pheomenon scenes feel repetitive. The BGM highjacks the scenes though it reduce as the time progresses. Oppenheimer is shown as a perfect man with almost everyone as his friend which is not the case even if you read his Wikipedia page. It doesn't even talk about let alone go in depth about his personal mental hardships, how he became a chain-smokers, etc. Which would have been an amazing plot points. Rami Malek can't blende into the character and his presence is same as any of his previous work except for Bohemian Rhapsody. RDJ is phenomenal actor, no one can tell if he is the same actor who played the Iron Man. Coming back to Wikipedia, even it has more Hindu references to Oppenheimer than this movie. The reference in this movie is intentionally insulting. Even if it is a 3 hour long, it doesn't feel very slow."
"In 25+ years of seeing movies at the movie theater have I left a movie early. The only good thing about this movie, was the acting and the wardrobe. The screenplay sucked. Made it about sex. Romanticized science. I couldn't even make it to the actual explosion. This film was pure propaganda at its finest. What a waste of money. If you do happen to go see this movie just be prepared to be underwhelmed. I saw the movie last night in imax. Why this was in imax I don't understand. The glasses did nothing. Hollywood is officially DEAD. Flaming pile of garbage. From Nolan too!?!?!? Would not recommend."
"An informative and dramatic biopic on the father of the atomic bomb, but it's not as stylish or atmospheric as Nolan's other films.- - - -- - - - - -It's an engaging and interesting story covering powerful topics with some tension in the first half as they race to create the bomb followed by a 'legal drama' aftermath in the second. Superb acting performances from the varied cast and the science was demonstrated and explained well, but the sex scenes felt out of place and the visuals, although impressive, were too few and far between.Overall, i would score Oppenheimer as a seven out of ten."
"Firstly, fantastic acting by Cillian and Downey. Amazing cameo by Gary Oldman. Rest of the cast were good nothing extraordinary. But my personal problem was the story makes a lot of jump cuts which is fine, but before going in the movie audience is expected to do a little bit of homework. Two hearings were going on in the beginning and only much later we are explained what's going on, but by that time I got exhausted just keeping up. Also once the explanation is given I didn't care enough. I usually don't check time or speak with anyone during the movie but it was very hard not to. I liked Downey's acting better than Cillian btw."
"I enjoyed Oppenheimer, it's a very well made and well acted movie. I though Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt were fantastic, Robert Downey Jr was good support.Not gonna lie though, the film suffered from the same thing all biographies do - they only ever shine a light on a small portion of the subjects life, I came out knowing only slightly more about Oppenheimer than when I went in.Also the film is 20 minutes too long, the sex scenes were unnecessary, some of the communist stuff became a slog and the bomb moment was kinda underwhelming.But I've recommended it to my friends and that's all a filmmaker can ask for I guess."
"Dont waste time watching, the whole cinema were sleeping , its too long , too boring, no story, streteched for nothing, every moment you are waiting for something to happen.Easily it could be 1hour shorterThe story was boringNo rhythm in the whole movie and if the movie was not for nolan im sure it would not sell 100,000$ even , i feel bad that nolan is having this in his edpeirence ,I was sleeping 30 minutes of the movie as it was completely boring and if you watch jt you will be sleeping as well , there waa totally no interesting atory and mo surprise in the story plus the visial effects were terrible."
"The bomb scene was so overhyped it killed the rest of the movie for me.Now I think of Nolan as a pretentious guy. Dude didn't want to use CGI and instead used whatever he used to make a real bomb. Such a dud. The impact of the movie was severely deflated by that weak showing of a atom bomb. I was so looking forward to feel the extreme feelings of seeing that bomb that the the movie was leading up to and it was so bad. Really so bad. Mushroom cloud, no ring, no devastation. The light wasn't that bright. Insane that a movie can be so hyped up over one scene and the scene was absolute crap.Shame on Christopher Nolan. CGI would have been better."
"Nolan has promoted the movie around the theme of atomic bomb stressing the significance of watching it only in imax theatres. But in reality besides a 10 minute scene of bomb detonation, there is nothing in the movie to hold your interest. Its literally the biggest scam of a movie. People have paid 3-4X of the price to watch this movie on imax but they all left infuriated at the end. Its 3 hours of people engaging in conversations - literal torture. Dude movies are meant for entertainment not to listen to boring dialogues. I honestly slept in the last 1 hour and i missed nothing. This is not only Nolans weakest film but the most boring film to come out in the last many years.Simple advice - ditch Nolan for Barbie this weekend."
"I had hoped to see more information regarding the creation of the explosives. For instance, I was positive that the movie would include the dragon's tail being tickled, yet it was not even mentioned. I was expecting for a movie with stuff like that. Do a search for Slotin, Daghlian, and tickling the dragon's tail if you are unfamiliar with this. In order to see what happens immediately before criticality, Slotin essentially moved two hemispheres of nuclear material slightly closer to one another. Oops! I know, big blunder. These events, I presume, weren't included since the majority of the movie had already ended by the time they occurred, which was after Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"This is one of the most tedious boring fims I have seen in a long time. 3 hours was about 21/2 hours too long. Unless you actually knew the history you would not be much wiser. How many people know how thermonuclear fission and fusion work and why it was so important. Odd bits were good but the constant jumping about was annoying. The casting was stereotyped although the actors did the best they could in the circumstances. And why did the sound have to be so deafening? The visual effects were cliched. Real pictures of an atomic bomb going off are dramatic enough without the swirling clouds. PS I hated Dunkirk too so I guess I am in the minority. I yearn for the days of cinema when there was a good story, well told and well acted. David Lean where are you? (I gues that gives my age away!)"
So I have watched this movie the opening is so great they started movie with awesome sound effects i really great ful to watch such movie but they really disappointed me on the Gita scene 😢 Even this book is one of the pure book in world I don't like this scene they derespect the book. But in other way this movie is great and this movie is for mature audiences and viewers in other you need to put your full attention of that movie this bomb sence was so realistic and beautiful the acting is also good and the character are so fit to all of them and enisten role is so perfect that last scene give you gossemebs.
"There is a famous Einstein quote: ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" In my opinion Nolan failed to explain it simply. Oh don't get me wrong I loved Inception, Interstellar and Dunkirk even though TBH I didn't understand Interstellar fully.I had great expectations from Oppenheimer, I wanted to watch it first day as it is about Manhattan project and Nolan made it. But I am disappointed as the move is all over the place. It fails to catch audiences' attention throughout the film, even I wanted to focus and try to understand but the movie was all over place. There is no doubt Cillian , RDJ, Emily and others were great in the movie, they are all great actors, but according to me the movie the fell short of what we expect of Nolan. From Nolan we expect our intellect joy and mind blown but nothing happened as such instead I got bored in few scenes."
"This movie should be on OTT, not theater, there is nothing IMAX worthy or 70mm justified, absolute waste of time and one of Nolan's worst, where the is guy who made exciting movies like Batman, Inception, Interstellar
What nonsense, the critics gave it 100 and such high ratings .. there is nothing in the movie that excites you
It's a boring , time testing , nonsense of a movie
I want my money back. I went with a friend and we wanted to leave 1/2 way through and we just were ready to get up but thought maybe give it a chance maybe there will be a twist or something .. nope
Oh gosh how we regretted. Trust me, save your money and go watch MI."
"It's so terrible and doesn't get better with time...Such a disappointment from Nolan. They could've made it much much shorter because the movie is sooo slow. The dialogues are so cringey and bad. The only good thing about this movie is cinematography. The acting is okay but since the whole plot of the movie is really bad it oftentimes comes off as cringey. I really recommend you not to watch this movie because you will only waste your money and time but also your IQ level. There are many unnecessary nudity and sex scenes as well. I was really looking forward to this, so I am very sad to write this."
"We knew what we were in for, we know the history, yet Christopher Nolan managed to knock it out of the park. He was not wrong when Nolan said Oppenheimer was his most abstract work. I will be honest, I liked the latter part of the movie much more. We could see the shades of grey in each character. Every actor did a splendid job, especially Cillian Murphy, he was exceptional and I would be shocked if he was not at least nominated for Oscars.Although I was not fortunate enough to watch it in IMAX, I loved the cinematography, loved Nolan's vision. I think I might have to watch it a second time!"
"It's a huge pile of rubbish. This film is a terrible show in terms of entertainment. The two hours pass only with talking. Names, names, names... communist party, politics, and so on. If I wanted this level of detail, I would have read a book. Why am I even coming to the cinema? Because I'm looking for entertainment. Due to this guy's ""I won't use CGI"" approach, we have to watch something that looks like a photo with added sound. There are so many dialogues in the movie that after a while, you lose track of the plot, and it becomes torture. I had to leave the theater because I couldn't breathe, and my brain neurons collapsed. I've never seen anything more embarrassing in my life. I don't even know if anything was shown in the last 15 minutes, and I don't care anymore."
"Christopher Nolan's obsession with hyperbolic noise and graphics comes to a head in 'Oppenheimer' in a long-foreseen bang, but the aftermath is short lived.A spectacle of sorts can be found in this film which many of us have craved since the summer blockbuster took a long absence. However, many of us were sated with Top Gun: Maverick last year and can do without the incessant preaching on how ""war = bad, politics = bad"". Were we supposed to feel tricked by an internal struggle against rooting for the success of Oppenheimer and his team's objectives?I'd rather not give credit to such fabrication."
"Aside from the sound design which was good, nothing here was really revolutionary. The mere length and drawn out dialogue made this film a snooze fest; the last time I wanted to leave the theater or just close my eyes was at the showing of the latest Matrix.Additionally, complex details of insignificance and multiple characters/ name dropping make it hard to follow for the average viewer unless you are already well versed on the backstory.Lastly, many scenes, in particular of the non-PG variety could have been cut out as they did not add to the story and wasted time.I would not suggest going out of your way to see this film. With 3 hours of a viewer's attention, you should walk away with something."
"I watched this 3 hour long movie which was mostly dialogue based with some very stunning cinematic moments. I felt the last hour was a stretch that could've been wrapped in half the time. Obviously the movie is relevant to regions of the world that were involved in WWII and revolves around an American figure who was able to produce the atomic bomb in remarkably record time. The controversies that surround his carrier and personal life was the center of this movie. I walked out feeling not being able to relate to most of it, except for the impact of his discovery on the nuclear proliferation in our current times.Not worth the 3 hours of watch in a theatre."
"Great story. Great expectations . Awful cinematography. Badly told story. The interesting and important parts interrupted by endless awful music and loud pointless explosions and noises interrupting the dialog which would've made the movie good. To much going on at once in an uncontrolled chaos of epileptic visual display . The music for this movie was incredibly poor. Any part of the movie that I can think of , be that visual sound or story , was always eclipsed by unexplained chaotic take over by something else. If it's a story then music. If it's a scenery then epileptic display. Never thought I'll make it though. Bad experience."
"Make no mistake, Christopher Nolan is a brilliant filmmaker. While reading the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, I felt that the narrative bogged down a bit in the forensic historiography of Oppenheimer's unfortunate excursions into left wing political politics during WW2 and the resultant McCarthyesque fallout after the dropping of the bomb. I feel that Mr. Nolan got caught in that same bog, and the film suffers a bit as a result. The rest of the film is brilliant, and might have come in better at the 160 minute mark. The dialogue in the first half was also unfortunately blared out by the soundtrack. I saw it in XD. A good watch for history buffs interested in the beginnings of the Cold War."
"A Film of 3 hours that somehow uses fast cuts the entire way through? Yep. Music all the way through? Yep. Just an overall loud soundtrack that had people put in earplugs around me? Yep. Let's just say it can be a little bit exhausting. At the same time, I can't help but feel like it could have been a better film had it been narrowed into 2 instead of 3 hours. It seems like it just contains too much information and overuse of dialogue to really keep you in your seat. Some of the characters just feel bland and emotionless. But maybe that's the way Nolan wanted it to be? That being said, it obviously has fantastic camera work, a great soundtrack and a couple minutes that were well done ( the speech scene and explosion). I just don't know if I could commit 3 hours of my life to watching it a second time..."
"I thought the movie was overall okay, obviously the cinematography was beautiful and the acting was great. I think the film was a bit ambitious and honestly way over-hyped. There were a lot of story lines that seemed unnecessary to include and definitely could've been shortened down. It was a little hard to follow at some points, and they mumbled a lot with very background music that was louder than the dialogue so sometimes I got lost, everyone in my group had the same complaint. The actual bomb scene as well was just extremely overhyped; that was probably the quietest part of the movie. Cillian Murphy did a great job. Some characters also just very random. It was almost like having a million little 15 second cameos of big faces. Lot's of unnecessary parts. Overall, though it was decent."
"Christopher Nolan has brought us an amazing story once again, visually pleasing, as well as amazing acting in the movie. If you love history this movie is down your alley.Cillian Murphy delivered an amazing performance as Oppenheimer, loved his acting and never got tired of it during the three hour long movie, and all the other actors did amazing as well.My only major complaint was that the third act kind of dragged on a little unnecessary, at least if felt like that. But the movie was still amazing.So many actors that some would not even notice that they just watched Gary Oldman on the screen, a true masterpiece though I wouldn't give it a ten out of ten."
This is a movie much more about politics and conspiracy than about the development of the nuclear bomb. The trailer is very misleading. The incessant music drowned out the dialogue and the non-chronological edits were very confusing. No charcter buildup. No emotion. A visually provocative biopic that seems less interested in character study. Hard to care about this movie. People and critics are saying they like this movie more than they do because they want to think of themselves as smart. Disappointed. This director is highly overrated and the false genius satus must have gone to his head.If you wanna see a good movie in the same genre watch the imitation game instead. Oppenheimer is not worth your time.
"I'm a movie buff. I love quality storytelling and Character development. This movie had none of these qualities. It was laden with music & sounds that were way too loud and completely distracting. Even to the point where, when you wanted to care about a character, you couldn't because the constant noise distracts. The acting and cinematography was good but if you don't know the story of Oppenheimer you will not understand. I recommend watching a biography of his life first so you can get a sense of what happened. This movie only touches on what actually happened. It's more of a courtroom drama.."
"The movie barely represents the Hiroshima and Nagasaki drama. Being at Hiroshima and visiting the museum I was shocked to see some depictions with the aftermath of such a horrendous act.Briefly showing the internal struggle in Oppenheimer's head regarding the morality of it and focusing more on the politics and on the romanticized meetings is unacceptable. For sure, Oppenheimer had nightmares about the bombs, but instead we are seeing some flashbacks and a carbonized body. That is it! Nothing else.Half of the movie is pointless, nobody cares about how Oppenheimer was discredited in the public for being a spy or that his clearance was dropped. Everybody cares about the horror of creating and using of such an absurdly overpowered weapon."
"There are two types of biographical films that can be made: one is a dry, realistic history lesson, and the other is a more exciting, though somewhat fictionalized, biographically inspired story. Oppenheimer is the worst combination of these two films. Based on the story, he is much more like Icarus than Prometheus, as he rose so high in his scientific career only to be burnt in political struggles.Unfortunately, it lacks everything that sets Nolan apart from other directors: the psychological game, symbolism, narrative symmetry, visual aesthetics, and dream-like cinematic experience. It's a typical creation that tries to compensate for its weaknesses with a star-studded cast. Even after three hours, we can't grasp the character, but at least we learn that nuclear weapons can destroy the entire planet. Who would have thought?"
The trailer and promotions of the movie seem to be about Manhattan project but on contrary it has too many sub plots pre and post Manhattan project. The political drama aspect explored in the movie remain very superficial and don't really grip the viewer.The viewer need to have knowledge of the political environment of 1950s in the USA. The movie doesn't give background before describing the events that occur during McCarthy era.There was also not much in the movie for big screens and iMax. The movie is more an abstract autobiography of Dr Oppenheimer.It is one time watch movie on the OTT and fell short of movies associated with Christopher Nolan.
"The movie was incredibly well done...for the first two hours. The last hour could have been written out as post script in the credits.Great filming and great acting, but they were carrying two separate movies-worth by the end.The difference between a good chef and a great chef is timing. I think that the same can be applied to movies: it can have the best acting, the best story to tell, the best filming, but if the timing is off-the whole movie suffers.I feel if you watched it again, the second storyline might catch on better. I cannot say I will be rushing back to rewatch it though. Maybe eventually."
"The volume in the Imax was set so high i missed half the dialogue, especially the mumbly Oppy. If he had much of importance to say I missed it and it made following the jumping about in time even harder to follow. EXCEPT Matt Damon. His enunciation is clear as a bell. He knows how to speak. Wish other actors had been to the same school. It is probably a much better film than i experienced, the visuals are stunning and ther is some science mingled with the human stories. So, disappointed. It would be so easy for directors to ensure their films are audible and for actors to address their audience."
"One of the most excruciatingly boring films I have seen in a long time. No stakes, no dramatic tension, no investment in the characters. Just endless dry dialogue often overlaid with very loud music so it was hard to even hear what was being said a lot of the time. I fell asleep and was unfortunate enough to wake up again with still 2 of the 3 hours to go. If I hadn't been there with my family I would have left. Christopher Nolan seemed more intent on proving his own intelligence than being a good storyteller. The messing around with the chronology was an example of this, as for me it detracted from the story rather than enhancing it. A very important and potentially gripping subject but this film did not do it justice at all in my opinion."
"""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's new film, is 4 stars maximum. And Cillian Murphy doesn't save the situation, only constantly widening his eyes in close-ups.It is a very difficult cinematic task - to film how people do science, so that there were no hackneyed formulas, sudden insights, complex gender relations and other banalities.And with Nolan, all these buffers follow one after another, and the result is a film about a typical conflict of professional ambitions in a closed research institute. In that sense, ""Nine Days of One Year"" rises head and shoulders above it.The only bright spot is Gary Oldman's two-minute role, in which he shows who is a great actor and who is not."
"Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan did a great job making this movie. It was a suspenseful, historically important movie. However, I am very disappointed that a movie that probably has cost a lot of money to make, did not even bother to check whether the Dutch (scene which was shot in Leiden) actually made sense. It was in fact, not Dutch, but German. This, especially considering that the timeline was during WW2, is shameful. WW2 was a difficult time for the Dutch, of which survivors, including my own grandma, are still alive. Older generations can take offence to this mistake, and it is just very sloppy."
"I fail to see how a three hour long movie can fail the bechdel test, your telling me in three hours there aren't two women that have a conversation about something other than a man. The lack of historical accuracy is shown by the lack of women that were important to the creation of the atom bomb that were not portrayed. This movie is romanticising someone that isn't even a good person that killed more than hundreds of people. It's incredibly boring.A boy film for boys about boys, building big boy bombs to hurt other boys. I don't even want to compare it to Barbie because there's more to say before that."
"This film should not exist: bad storytelling, awful casting and boring concept. I have a degree in physics and I like long deep movies, but this movie is nonsense. Story could be told in 15 mins, not 3 hours. Wasted my time on 50 identical man in old hats arguing about nothing in desert. It is like a bad documentary. How did you spend that amount money on this? Maybe if you are a fan of Oppenheimer's life, you can find this movie interesting. And everybody from the movie crew is faking successful start - I am sure all of them are laughing at the audience who have to watch this movie for 3 hours. And I wish Christofer Nolan good luck on the next episode - ""Oppenheimer 2: Oppy cannot decide what sauce to buy in supermarket"" - it could be 4 hours. And ""Oppenheimer 3: Oppy arguing with his neighbours"" - ideally for 5 hours. Peace for all - I don't want to start a nuclear war in comments - just dropping a little thing :)"
"Literally a three-hour documentary! The pace was quite good till the end of the Trinity test, which was shocking and exciting! However, the rest part I think it was just redundant! (Also because I almost can't hold up my pee so I can't really enjoy the latter half) Maybe Nolan thinks the later part was just echoing the right beginning, with due respect, I don't think so, to me it's just another hour's torture cause the rest of the plot is no longer hooking me and makes the ending chaotic. Yes, as the atoms and neutrons in an A-bomb would be, the 'great' Nolan adds his pacifist, anti-nuke ideology ingredients till he's done. I'm done, too."
"The first half has very strong buildup to the big explosion, but the delivery is severely lacking. Just search images of 'nuclear explosion milliseconds' and see what wicked visuals and dramatics were possible. Instead, you could set a can of gasoline on fire, scale it up a bit and you'd get the same result as in the movie.The story was very interesting to me though, as I was not very familiar with Oppenheimer. It's a bit hard to keep track of the characters and timeline, but it's manageable.Personally not a favourite movie, but you should definitely see it sometime, because it's a important story laid out in a good movie."
Its only for people who understands and are seriously involved. If you want to watch a movie to relax or get entertained this is not such movie. That bomb scene is like 10 secs and whole drama is vey boring. Another disappointment of directors movie. Like the movie tenet what the hello is going on there...similar feeling... get to the point took looong and the drama feels like I watching a documentary. But Robert and Murphy were good especially in scenes towards the end. All the enthusiasm on watching the bomb scene lasted barely 10secs and is not even a big scene... It's like any other bomb in any other movie..
"Starts off quick and awkward. Very hard to figure out what timeline you are in, throughout the movie. Apparently the future is in B&W, Totally not necessary, just confusing. I kept thinking ""geez, we are not in your head, Christopher Nolan, get some details in order"" Watching the documentary on Peacock was more enjoyable, and explained a alot. I can't imagine seeing this movie without watching the documentary first. I would have been completely lost, with it I was just merely lost. Too many, way too many characters to keep straight. If I had to choose a best character actor, I'd go with Matt Damon, although his first spout if anger was a bit off. There is much more to Oppenheimer the man, than what is portrayed. If I was streaming this 3 hour movie, I wouldn't have finished it. As it is, 4 people walked out of the theater before the 2 hour mark. Save tour time and money, and watch the documentary on Peacock."
"In this film, the scene where he is shown to be having sex and reading the Gita is totally unwarranted. It is an insult to the Gita and our civilization.So I don't like this film. It has come to notice that the movie 'Oppenheimer' contains a scene that makes a scathing attack on Hinduism. I recommended every Hindu don't watch this Faltu movie.In this film i like every scene but where he is shown to be having sex and reading the Gita is totally unwarranted.I know the film maker work hard but pls don't insult any holi book.So that why i don't like this film and i am not recommended any one to watch the movie."
"The film is a dull and tedious affair, with no sense of drama, emotion or insight. Nolan's direction is uninspired and bland, relying on clichés and exposition to tell a story that has been told better before. The cast is wasted, with no chemistry or charisma. The film is also too long, dragging on for nearly three hours, with no tension or excitement. People were literally sleeping in the hall, and I don't blame them. Oppenheimer is a disappointing and boring film that does not do justice to its subject or its audience. It is a waste of time and money. I give it one star out of five. I regret wasting my time."
"You will get a 3-hour movie that is not entertaining, not edifying, and not intellectually informative. The plot can be summarized in less than 5 minutes, therefore, you will get a lot of filling time when nothing really happens. Half o the movie is a combination of a boring meeting that never ends - you get one of these every day at work - and a mock trial. Moreover, add to it a lack of intellectual depth in all the conversations. The movie really misses the mark on all the aspects of plot/action, a shallow to no conversation/dialog between actors, unmoving/ordinary scenes, and a lack of character development. Add to it a continuous annoying sound that is meant to fill in stridently for the lack of emotion because the movie never gets going. If you don't like it, don't be afraid to recognize it because there is almost nothing to like. My recommendation is not to spend the time."
This movie was HUGE on dialog and nowhere near enough real action. Probably afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. The layer of music over top of the voice track was too much and made for too many missed words. All along I kept wishing for closed captioning so I could follow the story. For a 3 hour movie I completely expected more action. Sound decibel level was impressively loud. I expect some cinema grade loudspeakers got blown and probably startled a few Barbie movie goers in the theater next door. Time will tell if this was a hit. Might catch more streaming views so we can follow all the spoken words.
"I was so excited to see this movie since I am a big Nolan and Murphy fan, but I am hugely disappointed, the movie was too long and boring most of the times, they just glorified the act of making and dropping bombs(same usa propoganda).No doubt the visuals and acting was amazing but to sit through 3 hours and watch people just talk and arguing was not entertaining at all, they didn't even show the scenes or real bombing and what happened aftermath the bombings in Japan, there were too many characters to keep track of. Yes it has some scenes which will amaze and awe the viewers but overall it was disappointing for me😒"
"I wanted to rate this higher, but it was a struggle to watch the first two hours. We saw this in a Regal RPX theater and the musical score was deafening. I don't know if others feel the same way but there were many parts where I didn't make out the dialogue. The jumping around between scenes combined with the booming soundtrack underneath made it extremely difficult for me to understand what was happening at all times. I'll have to watch this again, at home, with the subtitles on. That being said, the third and final hour of the movie absolutely blew me away. Wow. We already know Oppenheimer made the bomb. We know the bombs were used on Japan (and WHY didn't Nolan show us that!??) But the AEC security commission review ""trial"" and the Senate nomination hearings for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr's role) could have been a standalone movie all by itself and I loved it. I read a lot of people didn't like the third hour but I completely disagree. It's the other way around for me."
"Too long, too much boring dialogue. There is more than an hour of film left. They forgot the primary objective of cinema, which is to entertain, and they got lost in cinematography, editing, sound, etc. How is it possible to make a movie about the father of the boring atomic bomb? The first hour and a half is so heavy. Unintelligible dialogues. Scientists sitting at the table boring us to infinity. The Florence Pugh part is so inconsequential. Luckily the last half hour with a brilliant Robert Downey Jr. The movie was better. Best: Robert Downey Jr. Worst: Overrated Everything. We need better stories."
"As an admirer of Nolan's work, I am very disappointed. First of all, the soundtrack sucks, it's just random ""bombing"" sounds that hardly fit in the movie. You can tell it's not Hans Zimmer. Second, it is an extremely confusing movie. It's as if the director had a million different ideas and just mixed them up together in a disorganized, completely random way. The timeline of the scenes is very random and hard to follow. Also, 3 hours was too long and after 2h I was bored. I feel like I just threw away 3h of my life. This movie is a very boring, confusing and soulless mess. I felt no emotion whatsoever from the movie, unlike with Nolan's other works. I wish it was more organized and concise."
"Well, I am spoiled with 'The animation game'. Compared to that movie I give 'Oppenheimer' a six. Oppenheimers character was not as sound displayed is Turings... Cracking the German code is also not so controversial as developing an atombomb... Mixed feelings.Somehow the English dramaturgic effects works better then the USA effects. The impossible love story in 'The animation game' was also more clear. The background everlasting dramatic music was a little overdone. Is it so hard to do something without music? The interrogation was complex, long and perhaps near to reality, but for me it made the movie unnecessaraly long."
"Capturing a wide array of historic events, characters and themes into one all-encompassing movie proves to be a difficult challenge for any director, and this one is no different.The audiovisual spectacle and certain performances (Robert Downey jr. In example) aside, the majority of scenes felt chaotic, sudden, and lacked length, leaving you with a constant sense of getting outpaced and needing to catch up. It's not necessarily the complexity of the chosen themes, but directional choices in how to portray them, that makes Oppenheimer feel like an overextended film trailer. Watching this is a Sisyphean task if you ask me."
"The whole movie builds up to the final scene being a propaganda message about mankind destroying itself with the bomb. We have had nukes for over 50 years and has not happened. Hollywood should pull its head out of its asd and just stick to storytelling. So sick of every movie turning into propaganda, gone are the days of Hollywood putting out anything worth watching. I am done watching anything on release day. I will want to hear a review of a film before going to watch it from now on. On the upside at least it accurately portrayed how self serving narcissists step on anyone they can to get a position of government power."
"By the hour and a half mark I was fighting to stay awake, this film is over hyped and convoluted. A good portion of it is just unnecessarily loud sounds for no reason and people yelling at each other. The entire thing felt like a poorly put together indie film festival entry. The explosion that was so hyped up was mediocre at best, I heard it wasn't cgi and that I should be impressed by it but that was not the case. I goto movies in theatre to be wowed, I don't care if it's cgi or 'real' as long as it's impressive and well done.The only way I recommend this movie is if you're looking for something to fall asleep to with it playing in the background. I would give this movie 0/10 if possible for the absolute waste of 3 hours. With all that being said it will probably go on to win academy awards and Oscar's."
"Quite disappointed. Story and timeline were all over the place. If you have never hear of Oppenheimer, you are still quite lost because the story line missed connecting to the audience. Really felt like I wasted 3.5 hours on a nice Sunday afternoon.I'm really surprised that the story was missed so badly. I Mt feels like the writers strike had something to do with this but sadly it doesn't.What a great opportunity it was that was missed to bring some important history to those that have forgotten or were just unaware.Movie was 3 hours + the previews. It made it feel like I watched an old baseball game before the pitch clock."
I should not even mention anything about direction as we know the director and that's why we go and watch his movies. The story revolves around oppenheimers inner fight of need to create the bomb and guilt of after effects. He is passionate about what he is doing but after the test he goes to guilt and hence wants to stop the escalating and research on making more bombs. Please do not expect any mind boggling action and adventure from this movie. It does not even show how the actual bomb got dropped. Once the test was done the work got over for oppenheimer.I would however rate rocketry over this movie.I also am strongly against the sex scene having gita shlok and it should be removed immediately.
"Exaltation of the character, where other physicists of greater importance such as Einstein or Heisenberg remain in the background. The references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki are very light and the effects of the explosion on the Japanese civilian population are not described at all. Made-in-USA product.Exaltation of the character, where other physicists of greater importance such as Einstein or Heisenberg remain in the background. The references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki are very light and the effects of the explosion on the Japanese civilian population are not described at all. It is very noticeable that it is a made-in-USA product."
I was so excited to watch this movie. My dream shattered and it's one of the most boring movie. First flop of Christopher Nolan.I won't trust the ratings anymore. It's just a scam I think. There was nothing in the movie...please save your time and money. Don't watch this movie. I am Nolan fan but it doesn't mean that I am going to like a messed up movie. After watching for over two hours. I decided sleep is better than watching this movie.1 star only for music.. they were just babbling in the whole movie. It's awful experience and I wasted my night. I am writing the review to save time and money of the people.
"This might be a controversial opinion, I thought the movie was boring, I felt this movie could have been a 30 minute YouTube documentary than 3 hours feature film. I felt the sound design was lazy. I was a bit underwhelmed by it.I feel that if we were to wind back time and re release this movie as directed by another alias, this movie wouldn't have this much rating.I had found a YouTube video of Robert Oppenheimer story by veretasium more entertaining than the Nolan's movie.On positive note, all the actors were exceptional. May be it's a bit unfair on Nolan that I had high expectations and the movie did not deliver."
"Really? Guys you really believe that? IS Oppenheimer Understood bhagwad geeta?& Accept with pure heart? No..he used Bhagwad geeta as Tool kit. & to get over regrets & guilt. & christopher nolan bloody conservative you made it intentionally bcz all western conservatives,hate hindusam & hindu culture. You shown bhagwad geeta in intimate scenes! I appreciate christopher nolan in technical way. But your thinking about as it s very wrong. Narayan hari. I offer my obeisances to the cowherd boy who holds the cow's garden and who is in the form of a cowherd boy.Gokulatsavamishanam Govindaam. Madhav."
"The first two hours are fine. By the final hour, the time period had jumped so many times that I lost the plot. As a result, after three hours, we still don't have a sense of who Oppenheimer was.The characters were not developed fully, and I'm wondering why the Robert Downey character was in the film at all. He added nothing to the story.The story was over after the trinity test, but it kept going...and going. And then without telling us why, suddenly powerful DC people are trying to ruin Oppenheimer.The film isn't bad, it just doesn't tell a story that is easily followed. But that's kind of a Nolan trademark."
"By no means is Oppenheimer a bad film - in fact I would recommend anyone looking for an experience to go check it out. However I do believe the film is a bit unorganized and is largely saved by good performances and great cinematography, at least up until the last one-half to one-third. After that, the story takes a more ""traditional"" route and cleans everything up nicely, barring a few things which I wish were done differently.Again. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for an alternative and perhaps a bit more ""high roller"" drama in the same category as ""The Theory of Everything"" / ""Goodwill Hunting"" / "" A Beautiful Mind"""
"""Openheimer"" was meant to be a captivating exploration of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and the atomic bomb's development. Unfortunately, it fell far short of expectations. This is not a movie for fans of Interstellar or Inception. This is a very long and very boring movie about a guy in a suit who figured out how to kill other people in an spectacular way. The amount of meetings and discussions going on reminds me of corporate calls on teams. Nolan jumps around timelines. Getting caught up in this maze is difficult and tiring. It was a terrible movie. In the end I left the cinema after two hours."
"With a decent screenplay and camerawork, Oppenheimer stands just above the surface of the worst. It's Cillian Murphy who makes you wanna sit and enjoy the 3 hours with his acting. The other cat members are also supportive to Nolan's good direction. There are certain scenes which are quite different from Nolan's previous movies, that's because it's a biopic. The first person experience and the court drama would make you feel bored but the sudden adrenaline of senses the music triggers just want to make you sit and watch what's gonna happen next. This movie and not for action lovers. It's kind of an new direction experiment film to Chris Nolan."
"In the middle of the ""over the speed limit"" pacing of the movie i was pretty much annoyed by all the lound music and jumpy cuts and moving your focus with lightning speed from one thing to another .I unfortunately felt that i needed to get over with it already . The acting was impeccable both murphy and robert were amazing .All i thought about was "" if only they just slowed it down and made it like chernobyl"" i wish i have loved it as much as everyone else but it was not the nolan movie i wanted to see .The story is amazing and how it was told was good also . It's such a shame that i felt the need to run out of the theatre as soon as it was done ."
"Hello...I did not watched it in IMAX cause in my city it wasn't available. But I had some better hope in respect of visuals and a powerful story. 2 mins of explosion was great but visuals weren't so impressive after and before that, I mean nothing unusual and story ah..a very very very ordinary story. A very normal story and the plot we have seen many times in many movies.So if you are going with some great expectations which I had you will not be satisfied and it is not the thing you are looking for.Music as usual good as u expect in Nolan movie but one tune was same like every movie of Nolan you will find it.But in the end I want to say that I was not expecting that shallow movie. Normal."
"This was an exhausting movie. While Nolan shows respect to his audience by providing a challenging plot to keep up with, viewers must actively listen to all the dialogue to follow along, a task which lasts the entire 3 hours. While the music and some of the visuals are great, the characters were not likable. Their complexity was evident but somehow non of them were relatable. The plot was detailed but seemed somewhat revisionist. The communists, the Japanese, and the protagonist himself were shown to be unjustly victimized. The movie is full of tension but never quite delivers. The payoff was entirely un-atomic. I don't see myself re-watching this movie.My ears are still ringing the day after. Perhaps that was the point."
The original was more about the making of the bomb. This movie left out a major part of the movie. Watch the original movie first. Fat man and little boy. I worked with a son of a man that actually worked on the Manhattan project. The acting in this version was good but the story line was not. Please everyone watch the original which most people never heard of. I can't say this enough watch the original I mentioned I think it was made in 1989. Thank you. I hope more people watch the original because of my post. I would never watch this movie again.You will see what I mean. Total disappointment !!!
"Just this just as I thought is just another typical world war 2 movie The fascist and the national socialist movements are the bad guys and the Communist are the good guys and we have to help certain group of people
Then we have to end the war by any means necessary and by any means necessary that we had to drop atomic bomb
Just we didn't meant to have destroyed two cities and I have more than hundred thousand people killed and don't get me started with the main character the protagonists Who belongs to the oven he created a weapon of mass destruction and he didn't know that the government will use it to end the war yeah right
Overall long story overacting and the good guys won the war."
"Oppenheimer is a good drama and biopic, but not an extraordinary movie like Nolan has done previously. As a fan, I would highly encourage him to return to his unique genres.This movie has good drama and music, as we all expect from Nolan and Ludwig, along with good twist in second half. Oppenheimer also captured the post- and pre-events of the Manhattan Project. However, I was expecting another Inception, Interstellar, or Tenet. I guess it was my naiveté that, even though I knew it was a biography, I was still expecting those things. However, I would expect the next movie from Nolan to be another Inception, Interstellar, or Tenet."
"This film has a few exciting elements, but it is two hours too long. Most of it is just uninteresting talk of boring men. We expected a masterpiece because of the reviews, but definitely wouldnt recommend. There is a clip out there of oppenheimer doing the 'i am become death, destroyer of worlds' wich truly captivates the darkness of the reality he lived and created. This film does not create anything more profound than this clip to be seen on youtube or wherever online. It said it took three hours, but it felt like six. I wouldn't spend time kf money on it looking back. I hope others enjoy it better."
"The kind of movie which peaked at the moments leading to the main event rather than the main event. Honestly, was a bit disappointed considering the hype it got . The politics , which is there substantially in the film was kind of boring and lengthy . Not a fan of the explosion or the sound effects considering the hype the film got in that partCinematography was next level , just as what to expect from a Christopher Nolan movie .Acting was outstanding. Suprised by how well Emily blunt did the scenes and instilled a whole new wow factor to the movie . Also the Black and white IMAX shots were also beautiful which gave a different feel to the movie . Also , try to understand basics of atomic reactions and bombs to grasp the scientific aspects of the movie better before you watch it ."
"Hello guys, first of all I'm sorry for my bad English I'm using my translator microphone. Hard to understand because it's going very fast. People who don't know about history, probably won't understand anything about the movie. Some scenes took my breath away.. I cried. At the beginning of the movie, I felt like the whole film is like a trailer. Because 80% of the movie is with background, music and talking. I liked it, but I wish it was a little bit easier to understand the actress also was perfect. Laughter you can see famous actors like from Drake and Josh or Mr. Robot. Have a nice day and sorry for this English."
"Although Cillian Murphy's performance was great and the fact that many known actors take part in the movie, (most of them you may recognize as you watch this movie), I simply think that the length of this movie is a huge gamechanger. Personally i have a short attention span and i found that the story doesn't captivate you enough to keep you entertained throughout the movie. Either way i would recommend you to watch the movie so that you can understande the ""hype"" behind it. If you are someone who gets bored and distracted easily i would advise you to choose a day where you are ok with the fact that you are going to spend the whole afternoon inside a theatre."
"Trying to insult the Bagavat Gita by reading it in the middle of a sex screen shows contempt and hatred to Hinduism (though bagavat Gita is a not a religious text (more a philosophicaltest), the intent in the movie seems religious ). The dirty mindset of the maker is obvious and the purpose of movie has shifted from entertainment to brewing hatred towards particular sect of humanity. Either the makers should apologize or the movie should be banned in my opinion.All the money and efforts into making a movie is worthless when the intent fails. I cannot hence appreciate any part of the movie - acting, directing, cinematography, bla bla."
"Oppenheimer is truly a complex character and it feels and reflects in the Christopher Nolan's adaptation. The film largely works and the 3 hour run time doesn't bother you too much. Acting masterclasses are on display in Cillian Murphy and RDJ and excellent support from Matt Damon.Only gripe is that the film only explores only one side of Oppenheimers character. Some of his real brilliance hasn't been shown at all and assumed the viewer would come prepared.Also the film, even though dark, doesnt quite bring out why the Truman govt tried to defame their national hero at the time. Its probably again left on viewers to educate themselves."
"Yep, just watched it. The whole 3 hours of it. True, it is a nice film. But man, the first hour there is not even 3 seconds to breathe. Just dialogue over dialogue over new character over new character.That leaves you confused and bored. You are really trying to make sense but some part of you thinks to leave the cinema.I think Mat Damon brought some positive feelings to the film. A little comedy, or a little ""out of order"".Towards the end there are some conclusions, hints of truth, feelings which will fulfill you.But it's not enough. IMAX is not needed at all. Half of the film is B/W."
"Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece, as it started out, but was quickly changed the tone when nudity was added in for no real reason at all. It honestly took away from the overall character of the film and ruined getting a pg-13 rating which would have been able to be seen by even more fans. It felt like something added in by producers to get more views or add something spicy to the content. It film was unreal, the acting was amazing, and the overall feel of the movie was left confused by the length and seemed drawn out more than his other films. It could have been a hour cut off in just unneeded dialogue."
"Great movie, but with a great fault; not a minor, but a major historical failure to show the central role that president Roosevelt played in the first years of the relevant period. Einstein and others convinced president Roosevelt that Germany was in the process of developing an atomic bomb and it was Roosevelt who decided to launch the Manhatten Project. It was also Roosevelt who sent a letter to Oppenheimer thanking him for leading the successful work in New Mexico. A film about Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb without a role for FDR is like making a film about The Battle of Britain without Winston Churchill.Yours Gideon Zlotnik."
"Going into the cinema I had really high expectations for this movie. The movie lacked the ""amazing special effects"" in where it was loudly marketed, (watched it on IMAX) and because of this, I felt cheated of an amazing visual experience. Another issue I have with this movie was the weird tangling of events, it felt like the movie was trying to show so much, thus making it boring and uninteresting. The actors did great, but that's about it ""great"". I also despised a lot of the cinematography, too many close ups and ""average"" angles. The storyline was okay, acting was okay, cinematography okay."
"Perhaps the first Nolan film that could have potentially benefited from computer-generated effects. Nolan is a master at narrating a visual story through traditional means, but this time the wonder of splitting the atom remained somewhat remote. Traditional explosions and spark showers, created with pyrotechnics, even seemed naive in depicting the incredible power of nuclear fission.The film was long, but not tediously so. The complex navigation of Oppenheimer through the jungle of human relationships and political connections was skillfully executed. The only thing that distracted in the story was the excessive focus on Oppenheimer's interrogations - this could have been trimmed down."
"Both visuals and cinematics where great, also the acting is spot on. You can see Nolan really showed his skills. To be short: a great imax movie without CGI. But it's very long (3 hours) and a lot of time is consumed to intensify scenes, rather than explaining how hard it was to let an plutonium bomb work at critical mass and the accidents with it was not shown. Also the detonation of the device where a little bit underwhelming consider the trailer, besides it's hard to reduplicate without cgi. Some documentaries online are more accurate but as a movie it's great. Also the ""Dutch"" he spoke is not understandable as a Dutch person myself, it sounded more like German."
"""Oppenheimer"" disappoints with lackluster cinematography, bland dialogue and a poorly written screenplay. The visuals lack depth, leaving viewers detached, while wooden dialogue fails to engage. Moreover, ""Oppenheimer"" perpetuates the narrative of male hegemony, while women appear briefly and unnecessarily naked on screen.The narrative lacks cohesion, with scenes disjointed and poorly connected, leaving viewers struggling to follow the story's progression. Characters often behave in inexplicable ways, leaving audiences perplexed and disinterested in their fates.From the sluggish pace to the monotonous dialogue, every aspect contributes to the overwhelming feeling of boredom. Unfortunately, it falls short of being a compelling cinematic experience, leaving viewers counting down the minutes until the credits roll."
"Looking at the review I was really excited to go and watch this movie.I shouldn't have bothered! So many historic fact missing, so did they not get radioactive effect from watching the explosion in the US of course they did never showed or mentioned, little mention of the impact on Hiroshima but no details, once again a film that portrays government has coward and need scapegoat to justify their actions, one question is how can you be Jewish and communist?Who cares about the love story and the cheating, it wasn't that relevant to the story.I had high expectations it didn't deliver I feel cheated."
"It's the first time in years I wanted to walk out of a movie. The fast transitions between scenes tied together with constant background music makes it almost unwatchable. The first 90 minutes felt like going through some IG reel where everything had to be hyped up to keep people interested. Not each and every line the character says has to be epic. Not each and every scene needs epic music building up to create tension. The movie feels flat from this point of view. It keeps running on high octane. Where are the moments of calm that help build up the tension? It's just tension in almost every scene. It feels so unnatural and out of place. The second part of the movie feels a bit better. Robert Downey Jr. Does an amazing job, so does Murphy. It's the pace of the movie that's the problem. I would have had no problem watching this as a mini series like Chernobyl. You would be able to present all of the important information without trying to capture everything in 3 hours and rushing things. It could have been something great. But it's not. 7.2/10."
"To be fair I had a bad seat stuck in the corner. Also, there was something with the audio in the film or theater. I couldn't make out parts of the dialog over the background/scene noise.Too much time spent on Oppenheimer himself, wanted to know more about the other scientists. Political intrigue bores me. Should have spent more time on the women in his life or don't cover it at all.Could have watch a 3-hr movie of scientists in a room talking the theory and math of quantum physics even if it was just the surface level stuff I already know.I took Matt Damon's advice and left after the trinity event."
"I like Chris Nolan movies, biopics, and the subject of this movie but score was over the top and gave me a headache. Think people would have been falling asleep if not for the exaggerated score that makes you feel like you're having an anxiety attack for 3 hours. Topic is interesting but more befitting a documentary and would have been way more relevant if someone made this movie in the 80s when cold war and nuclear holocaust were still a concern of people. Felt like they didn't explain Robert Downey Jrs' character enough for him to be the antagonist they used him as. Not a bad movie, just not the masterpiece people are calling it. Kind of movie you may never rewatch."
"Regarding Christopher Nolan,
He has insulted the Bhagavad Gita by depicting it in an inappropriate scene related to intercourse. The Bhagavad Gita is considered a holy book in Hinduism, and it should not have been portrayed in such a manner. This depiction is a disrespect to the sacredness of the Gita. Even though openhimer have taken inspiration from the Gita, there was no need to include it in that particular scene.Nolan should apologize to the Hindu community for using the Gita in such a manner and seek forgiveness from the followers of Hinduism.Say sorry nolan, you can insult gita,Say sorry."
"If you like biography movies, you gonna enjoy it even though it's a bit long & suddenly gets complicated for no reason other than it's a Nolan movie so it has to be..
One thing I'm sure about is that Oppenheimer will win the Oscar for any sound related Awards..
The visual side of the movie is great and you can tell it's a Nolan movie, so if that's something you like you gonna enjoy it..
For the casting I think Cillian Murphy did a fantastic job he wasn't over the top as some other actors in a biography movies, although she didn't have much screen time Florence Pugh as usual proves to world that she is be the best actress right now.."
"Christopher Nolan used to be able to be counted on for delivering high quality, thought provoking, educated films that never ventured into the explicit (be it sex, nudity, or language). The majority of his previous films were standards of excellence, always looked forward to, and never required audiences to worry about what content they were about to see. I think many Hollywood professionals underestimate the amount of viewers who filter entertainment they see by their individual moral codes and consciences. Great storytelling (especially in writing) should be able to be portrayed without relying on the explicit. Would have loved to have been a Oppenheimer fan, but unfortunately Nolan has excluded viewers like myself from his latest film."
"It was like vanilla ice cream: not too bad and never too good. A very interesting topic, one of the biggest historical event but there was never a great moment in the movie. A very boring take on a larger than life topic. This could have been a movie that could inspire millions.There was potential for several goosebump moment at many different points but it turned out to be a very okayish. Guy on my next sleep was sleeping. I never thought that a movie about bomb can be so bland. I wanted to like this movie but there was never a moment that i would take home.Nolan is just taking significants world war event and turning them into forgettable average movies. After Dunkirk this is strike2."
I was disappointed in this Nolan movie because it's such a departure from his string of intense and cerebral movies. It's Mostly about politics during the time period. Great acting by all the cast but it has completely unnecessary soft porn that ruins the story line. Don't bring young kids! Good stuff includes the history of the creation of the bomb and how Oppy struggled with the consequences once it was built. The story line about how Strauss was involved was very interesting. I would bet that very few people know about his struggles after the WWII ended. This is a long one so get comfortable.
"Don't watch! Sheer wastage of money. Only lawyers might like this film. Christopher Nolan please retire gracefully than making mediocre films like these! Whatever was good was shown in the trailer nothing new. Switching between black and white was stupid. Was not hooked to it in the first few minutes. First two hours were really draggy and slow. Atomic explosion, has so much expectations from that shot, but it was just average. My nephew slept through the film (who has never done that till date).Sound design absolutely below average. That stupid foot tapping played 100 times. Too much back and forth and unnecessary details in the film. Should have been named Documentary about Oppenheimer !"
"The story of Oppenheimer is told in Nolan's way - with a great set of actors, non-linear screenplay, and overly done background music. Of course, the tunes taken out of the context would sound great. But they are less enjoyable in a movie laden with conversations.At this point, hiding behind the ""need of the story"", heavily cued background music together with whisper-like conversations is becoming Nolan's notorious habit. With the anticipation built for the movie, the audience has at least some familiarity with the story and the characters involved. Were the conversations not meant to be heard or is it a cheap trick to keep us talking about the movie?While the non-linear style makes the story fascinating, the signature recklessness with the audio continues, almost becoming vulgar this time."
"Had it not been for the nudity, I would have loved this movie. So disappointed in the decision to lower such standards for trashy scenes. We can understand that people are nude without actually having to view it. Several of us saw the movie together and agreed the nudity was completely uncalled for. Don't we get enough of society trying to shove that junk down our throats? Just adding to the problem of too many hormones running around to the point of affecting children and all the human trafficking problems. So disappointed in this film and it's director and producers. It could have been such an amazing film."
"A star-studded cast brings a very interesting although dialog heavy presentation of the trials of J Oppenheimef and his role in creating the automic bomb. The cast delivers stellar performances but the movie drags on partly because it is so thick in content and dialog, but also because as usual with a Nolan film, will likely require a second viewing to get all the nuances. Both it's strength and it's weakness, is the subject matter about the controversies surrounding the atomic boom: it will seem like an old rehash by many viewers, and like a fresh look to others. In either case, the acting and writing presents excellent and fresh content about the life and trials of Oppenheimer."
"I tried too much to like this one, but I couldn't at all and I don't even see the point, why they kept talking about shooting the whole movie by Imax cameras ? .. It's not an action film and 'it's not visually impressive at all, and all this talk about the Imax camera and the perfect seats to experience the movie seams so funny now after watching it.(Side note)
most of the audience seemed not to care what's happening after about an hour in the movie and just started scrolling on their phone till something more interesting happens.By far my least Nolan film
Incoherent and very underwhelming
6/10."
"I rarely write a review ..but this time i couldn't resist staying a side without expelling my feeling after seeing the movie..i left the Sal in the mid of the movie...the movie is 3h i barley could sit & hold back in my seat for 1.5h..deadly boring..one of the very few movies that left the movie in the middle ...
Oppenheimer and the script in general is very stretched...the 1st 1.5h could summarize it into 10 min max....the development of the main characters very slow..and evolves meaningless crap love stories that doesn't contribute by anyway to the plot..
stay away & Save your 3h boring time awaiting you."
"I was told I was seeing the Barbie film tonight. Apparently my ""friends"" tricked me. I was about four hours into this when I said to myself ""wow they not only made Ken super smart, but the focal point of this entire thing.""
I have never heard him referred to anything besides ""Ken"", so I assumed he just had some sort of Nordic/Germanic/Jewish heritage that Matel didn't tell us about. Thought I'd see a lot more hot pink colors, but this sadly was mostly black and white or just close ups of the bright yellow sun. Not bad though.Was gonna give this one star because of no Margot Robbie but I gave it two as a kudos to my friends clever ruse."
"When you see that this movie was made by Christopher Nolan and the whole impressive cast you think that you will see best movie of this year .. but what I saw was unexpected and overrated movie unfortunately, 3 hours is too long to this story.Christopher Nolan Said better to see the movie in IMAX screen .. naaah it's enough to see it from your phone screen.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Rami Malek they deserve better story than this one, I think Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey gonna win some prizes for there legendary performance.Overall that movie is overrated, under expectations and disappointing."
"Acting, Production design is good but they gave too much hype for the movie since I expected good VFX such as in Interstellar, Inception, Tenet etc.In the movie, reading the Gita quote during an intimate scene is VERY BIG INSULT to the sentiment of Hindus, not only in India but throughout the world. If it would have been Bible or Quran, would they include it in the scene? Never, because their religious sentiments get hurt (Irony!!)Didn't expect this from Chris Nolan. He is my inspiration and hero for his ultimate dramatic and visually baffling movies but his character is degraded to such an extent that he wrote the screenplay for THAT scene in such a manner.Let's fight to remove that intimate scene from the movie all over the world!!!"
"Nice good. It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all,It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

I was very hyped about this movie but I'm somewhat disappointed. I found this movie more focused on the bureaucracy. It could have been more focused on the scientific part like the inventions of physics during this project. I also believe many important scientists who contributed in this project were not highlighted along with the research part for the test. Also this movie was not thought provoking much as compared to other Nolan movies. I cannot help it but comparing this movie with Parmanu movie of Bollywood and I found Parmanu more exciting than Oppenheimer. Felt like this was made in rush. Sorry.
"Bla bla bla three hours of talking and talking and still more talking..............
A very long and very boring movie that did not touch on the Japanese or Soviet side......
Where is the bomb? How did they drop it? What happened before and after?This movie is more biography than a cinematic masterpiece sadly...........
Soundtrack was nice but still not enough to sit three hours watching men talking and talking.This movie could be a scene from a real movie about the blast in Hiroshima or the atomic bomb..........
Anyway some ppl enjoyed it, I didn't.........
All guys were going to watch Barbie, I understand why."
"I thought the acting in this film was exceptional, to a person. I also didn't think it was too long, and it covered everything that seemed important. My only gripe is the fact that the musical score dominated the film and felt manipulative. In that I mean that there was enough tension and excitement without hearing a thousand violins ramping up the tension. It often was simply too loud. And it made it harder to really hear the dialogue. The scenes I found most satisfying were those where the music was muted and the dialogue came through.I guess as a woman, I felt the portrayals of the two main women, his wife and his troubled lover, probably made them look less capable than they really were. The exception being the late scene when his wife faces the investigating panel."
"Saw Oppenheimer in IMAX format. It's a decent enough biopic but itvsuffers from an unjustified grandiose directorial style. Nokan's insistence on film vs digital and penchant for unnecessary melodrama make it seem like more of a major work than it actually is. It's worth seeing, to be sure, but I think it's one of those overhyped productions that will be lost in the dusty film archive where pomposity goes to die.The sound level, which the theater insists was set according to strict instructions from the studio, was abusively loud. My hearing threshold was messed up for hours after the viewing. Bring ear protection if you see it in theater, just in case. Actually this film just barely justifies theater viewing - - it's probably more enjoyable to simply watch on your big screen at home."
"The movie is little slow / long, lacks the quality of screenplay / dialogue which is hallmark of Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy movies 🎥. The the absence of powerful language and emotions doesn't provide a fair opportunity to properly exhibit the acting talent of Murphy. If, one goes, with quality and content of Peaky Blinders, he will be disappointed. Over all a good and worth watching movie to understand this important character/event in history. Resemblances can be found between Dr. Oppenheimer and Dr. A. Q. Khan of Pakistan. They restored his honour partially in 1963 and finally in 2022 when his security clearance withdrawal in 1954 was revoked."
"Did not love it but definitely liked it.... Not at all a Nolan movie.. More like Aaron Sorkin film... Quite similar to Social network, trial of Chicago seven, and Mollys game.... Oscar nomination for Adapted screenplay and supporting character for RDJ... Nolans easiest accessible movie where nothing of the story is left for audience imagination.....just for the sake of complexity, non linear storytelling seems to be adopted... Still quite enjoyableFor bgm sake one should watch it in theatre.... Otherwise OTT also fine...Lot of dialogue with lots of characters, mostly from physics and chemistry books 😜😜"
"The movie was fine honestly not my favorite. While the elements such as costumes, sets, and cinematography are amazing and done very well I think the movie is half baked. At many points I wish they would show less of something and show wayyyy more of something else. Definitely wish we saw more of the bombing. If you are someone who is into ""films"" or interested in this part of history definitely recommend watching but for just a causal viewer I personally wouldn't recommend. Also the never ended celebrity cameos sorta took me out of the illusion. Josh Peck being in the movie is so unserious. The sex scenes are not that intense but definitely a skip for young viewers."
"As an Indian adult this movie is great or kinda good for me ,but the nude part of film is really unnecessary
And movie makers can skip it and Shelby said he read bhagwat Gita for his movie ....for what he read for that kind of stupid stuff... I'm not happy for that scene ...and some where I'm unable to connect with Einstein...and Robert Downey Jr......... And I'm giving 7 star for the way the movie was directed by Nolan sir and performance and the voice artist.... Basically the reason made me said good to this movie is like the time line ....like 3 time line is going on this movie....this movie is not for immature audiance.....this part I like the most so I give it like 6 or 7 star."
"Loved the movie, loved the actors efforts. After three hours I could again feel the fear from the Cold War. Impressive. Camera work in general is very professional.But am so distracted by the endless smoking cigarettes. Not necessary and the year of origin might not be an excuse. A Hollywood investigation into the smoking lobby should be in place. How many investment came from tobacco?And the worst moment: no wind in the open tower. On the ground the weather is awful. Winds all around the house and cars. But heb Oppenheimer climbs the stairs. And up there: Cables completely still.That's a huge production error."
"Acting was tremendous and the true story behind it is a pot of gold. But I felt it was way too long. Could have been 1.5hr easily. It's like the Editor had all these great scenes and at the end decided to keep them all in. Also there was a lot of minute detail about the political history, yet not enough for a history buff like me satisfied. The music was WAY overdramatic for my tastes, heightening the drama in anticipation of some huge climax.. only to be let down with some meaningless line. People were asleep in the theater all around us, including my wife, and I admit struggling to stay awake myself."
"Wow! The hype clip from earlier this year did this film no justice. Scene by scene, line by line you feel Oppenheimer's struggle and his shift in morality. This movie will be mentioned as an all time classic. A masterclass of film making as well as acting. Murphy, Blunt, Downey, & Damon all deserve merit, credit, and all the accolades for top their notch performances. Paced extremely well (a three hour experience) does not feel like three hours. Excellent audio and visuals throughout. There is nothing I can complain or criticize about this film. It's the perfect film. The Godfather level perfection. This should be a fixture at every IMAX theater in perpetuity. Go see it. If you have already seen it once, see it again."
"Excellent direction and acting . You never get to see Cilian Murphy, you only see J Robert Oppenheimer. The rest of the cast was fantastic as well, special mention to Robert Downey Jr. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt all give an excellent performance. Ludwid Gorranson's score sends chill throughout the body. My only issue was with the sound mixing. In certain parts the score gets a bit too loud that it's a bit difficult to listen to the dialogue between the actors, but it won't be an issue if subtitles are shown. Overall outstanding movie and expect at least 3-4 Academy award nominations. 9.6/10."
